Bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations - Bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries on judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations - Development of an EU criminal justice area (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Tadeusz Zwiefka, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations - C6-0001/2009 -
the report by GÃ©rard Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries on judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, and applicable law in matters relating to maintenance obligations - C6-0035/2009 -, and
the report by Maria Grazia Pagano, on behalf of Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on development of an EU criminal justice area, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on development of an EU criminal justice area.
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to extend my very warm thanks for our successful work together to the rapporteur from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Deprez, all the shadow rapporteurs, and the representatives of the Czech Presidency and the European Commission.
In spite of our fairly distant initial negotiating positions, we have managed to reach a compromise, which, I hope, will allow us to come to an understanding with the Council at first reading.
The proposal for a regulation establishes a mechanism, on the basis of which Member States will be able to renegotiate, negotiate and conclude bilateral agreements with third countries in the area of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters.
An analogical mechanism is foreseen in relation to bilateral agreements in the area of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations.
It is a response to the practical problem which arose in consequence of Opinion 1/03 of the European Court of Justice on the new Lugano Convention, in accordance with which the Communities are competent to conclude external agreements to the same extent that they used the mandate to accept legal means in the area of judicial cooperation in civil cases under Article 61(c) of the EC Treaty.
The proposed instrument establishes a special procedure.
For this reason, the legal frameworks of the proposed mechanism must be strictly limited both in terms of scope and time.
The first condition is met by limiting the proposed regulation to bilateral agreements in the areas of jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in civil and commercial matters.
The second condition is met by the 'sunset clause', in accordance with which an agreement concluded under this procedure automatically loses force at the moment of conclusion of an agreement by the Communities with a third country.
Admittedly I do see the need to include in the legal frameworks the matter of performance of external competencies in the area which includes the specific law of contractual and non-contractual obligations, and also of matrimonial matters.
However, it would seem to be necessary to make clear that the proposed mechanism will be applicable not only to sectoral agreements determined by the limited scope of this proposal, but also to other agreements such as bilateral understandings and regional agreements between a limited number of Member States and neighbouring third countries - of course only in very limited cases, concerning specific matters, and with the intention of resolving local problems.
I was sceptical as to the need to set the 'sunset clause' at 31 December 2014, if, according to the proposed regulation, the European Commission has to present a report on the application of the resolution by 1 January 2014. In addition, the process of negotiating agreements with third countries is often complicated and lengthy, and does not leave Member States much time to make use of the new procedure.
Therefore the compromise proposal for the regulation to expire on 31 December 2019 allows a more complete and effective use of the procedure by Member States.
Despite the differing view of the European Commission, I am of the opinion that in its report on the application of the regulation the Commission should present the regulation in the context of other legislative instruments, such as Brussels I. The proposed mechanism, which includes a two-stage control function on the part of the Commission, will undoubtedly serve to ensure cohesion with the acquis.
However, I have tried to achieve the greatest possible flexibility in the proposed procedure and a shortening of the times designated for the Commission to react, and also a reduction in the bureaucratic load.
Democratic authorisation and the role of the European Parliament are not in any doubt, and therefore I also insist that the European Parliament and the Member States be given information at every stage, from the intention of a Member State to start negotiations with a third country through to conclusion of an agreement.
I would like to stress that the procedure for concluding bilateral agreements with third countries gives us a unique opportunity to demonstrate that the European Union is able to solve the problems of its citizens in their interest, which is particularly important in the context of the economic crisis and the growing Euroscepticism in many Member States.
In conclusion, Mr President, in spite of certain differences of approach in a specifically legal sense we must show our pragmatism here, while of course respecting the acquis communautaire.
Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Zwiefka just said, we are simultaneously discussing two reports which have different scopes, but which form part of the same logic and are subject to identical procedures.
The first, for which Mr Zwiefka is the rapporteur - and I wish to thank him for the courtesy he has shown me and for his patience when faced with some of my demands -relates to a proposal for a regulation under the codecision procedure.
The second, for which I am the rapporteur, involves a proposal for a regulation that merely provides for consultation of the European Parliament.
In essence, Mr President - and I agree on this - the problems that we are trying to solve with these two instruments are serious and very often really tragic.
Each of us has heard of or knows cases where a marriage with a person from a third country has failed and where the father or more often the mother no longer has the right to see the children, who have been taken by the spouse to his or her country of origin or elsewhere, and sometimes is unable to discover their whereabouts.
The same goes for the possibility of receiving maintenance payments.
Clearly, these issues are real, serious and tragic.
There is an urgent, legitimate need to attempt to find a solution to this, in particular by negotiating agreements with third countries.
What, though, is the origin of the issue that we are concerned with today?
Why is it that the European institutions have to deal with this problem?
The answer is simple.
For all of these matters, the negotiation and conclusion of agreements with one or more third countries falls within the exclusive competence of the Community.
The exclusively Community nature of these matters is explicitly confirmed by rulings from the Court of Justice and the opinions of the legal services.
This means that what appeared to be very simple is, in fact, a little more complicated and more sensitive.
So the question now is this: is it legally possible, given the current state of the Treaties and the case-law of the Court, to allow the Member States to exercise one of the Community's exclusive competences and, if so, under what conditions?
Personally, Mr President, I am not a great legal expert.
I am not a legal expert at all, but I have not found a legal basis in the current Treaties that would explicitly authorise the Community wholly or partially to surrender its exclusive competences for the benefit of the Member States.
This means that I, for my part, remain very puzzled and very doubtful as to the very principle of the mechanism that is proposed to us.
Having said that, I must admit that the opinions of our institutions' legal services have opened some doors.
That is very clear.
For example, Commissioner, the opinion of your institution's legal service, and I quote: 'agrees that the exercise of external Community competence by the Member States is legally possible in exceptional circumstances and under specific conditions, both in form and in substance'.
The European Parliament's legal service is much less explicit, although it did offer some possibilities.
It is these very precise and restrictive legal principles that formed the basis of the amendments I tabled, and of the negotiations in which I took part, which were held in trialogue with the Council and the Commission.
I am, I repeat, very aware of the tragedies suffered by some of our fellow citizens and I am determined to make great efforts to help them.
That is why, in the end, I agreed to the compromise negotiated with the Council and the Commission, but I wish to make it very clear, Mr President, Commissioner, that the Community's exclusive competence must remain as such.
The Member States must not, by granting countless derogations and broadening the scope, end up reclaiming what is an exclusive Community competence.
That is the line that I have taken and, in the future, that is the line that I will defend.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by warmly thanking everyone, all my fellow Members and officials who have made a contribution to improving the text we will vote on tomorrow.
My particular gratitude goes to Mr Demetriou, whose previous excellent recommendation provided a starting point for my report.
In my work, I was always very aware of the need to provide useful guidelines for building an authentic European space for legal cooperation and I hope, rather, I am convinced, that my work may again be useful to the forthcoming Swedish Presidency, which will be faced with the difficult task of drafting the Stockholm programme.
I started with two considerations when drawing up the text: the first was that criminal processes have numerous and important implications for fundamental freedoms, both for the victims of crime and also for suspects and defendants.
The priority that this Parliament cannot fail to emphasise and the main crux of my report is therefore a focus on respect for human rights.
Much space was devoted in the recommendation precisely to the defence of fundamental rights, with particular attention given to victim protection, prison conditions, prisoners' rights and procedural guarantees, including the right to be told one's rights and to the assistance of an officially appointed lawyer, the right to evidence, the right to be informed of the nature of and the reasons for the charges and to gain access to the relevant documents in an understandable language, the right, then, to an interpreter.
The second consideration on which I based my report is that, as may be seen from the report on the implementation of the Hague Programme for 2007, the level of implementation with regard to legal cooperation in the criminal field was somewhat low, even though satisfactory developments were registered in other sectors, such as civil co-operation, border management, immigration and asylum policies.
It is therefore clear that something more must be done.
The principle of mutual recognition, the cornerstone of mutual cooperation, is very far from being satisfactorily recognised.
We need to get to the root of the problem, identifying the causes of this disappointingly low increase so that we can prepare the most effective solutions.
I believe that the main causes lie in the lack of reciprocal awareness and trust between States, and in the report I therefore lay emphasis on training, assessment, information sharing and good practice.
When it comes to training, we must certainly not overlook the considerable steps forward, made in particular due to the training contribution offered by the European Judicial Training Network.
In my opinion, we nevertheless need to go beyond the current training model based mainly on national postgraduate schools in order to build a stronger common judicial culture, which is still lacking.
For this reason, I highlighted the need to move towards a well-organised European training institute for judges and lawyers, with adequate resources, yet referred to the need to avoid pointless duplication between existing facilities and highlighted the important role of national schools.
Secondly: we need a more effective all-round assessment mechanism of justice, of judicial authorities and of the implementation of European Union directives.
The report therefore proposes setting up a group of experts to permanently monitor the application of Community law and the quality and effectiveness of justice, on the model of the Schengen mutual evaluation system.
Its purpose is also to identify any weaknesses in the system and legislative shortcomings in the matter of criminal judicial cooperation in order to provide the European legislator with all the information resources required for a proper political and regulatory assessment.
Lastly, the use of new technologies, which are very important for data collection, reinforces existing database systems and the circulation of information.
I hope that tomorrow's vote will be a repeat of the excellent result achieved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Mr President, I wish, of course, to thank the three rapporteurs, and I will first of all turn to Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez.
Obviously the Commission is glad that compromises have been reached.
That said, it is correct that there have been intense negotiations since February and that we have thus reached an agreement at first reading on the two proposals presented by the Commission at the end of 2008.
This is a very sensitive area for all the institutions involved - Commission, Council, European Parliament - as Mr Deprez has highlighted so well.
I thank all of the parties for having arrived at a text that seems to us to respect the Commission's institutional prerogatives and, at the same time, seems to be a response to the legitimate expectations of the Member States and of Parliament.
I would, however, point out that this is an exceptional procedure, limited in scope and in time, and that the Community's exclusive competence in the matters involved must, in any case, continue to be respected.
I am very firm on this and I agree with what Mr Deprez said, when he pointed out that the Member States must not take advantage in this way of the situation to reclaim certain competences and to encourage the Commission to somehow abandon the idea of making proposals.
I believe that we are in full agreement on this matter.
That said, it is also the case that this flexibility will allow the Member States to enjoy, where the Community does not exercise its competence, an institutional framework to help citizens gain access to justice in third countries, especially in the area of family rights.
It is true, too - Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez alluded to this - that we must think about the rules relating to divorce, the custody of children, access rights and maintenance obligations, and about the painful situations that can arise for want of legislation that is universally applicable to these areas, at international level.
The proposal on the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations could also have a positive effect on the resolution of very concrete, very specific problems, such as those related, for example, to road and river traffic, or the management of airports located at the borders of several States, such as the Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg airport.
That being said, this is another application of this institutional framework which must, once more, remain the exception.
I would like in any case to thank the rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the work they have achieved, and I also thank them for their understanding, which has allowed this agreement to be reached before the end of this Parliament's term of office.
I will now mention the report by Mrs Pagano, with whose approach and content I am in agreement.
I welcome Parliament's growing involvement in the area of criminal justice, not merely as regards legislative action, but also as regards the design of the future of the European area of criminal justice.
Thank you, Mrs Pagano, for having given your support to the work we are doing at present, since we are preparing the Stockholm Programme and we will be publishing a communication containing recommendations for the period 2010 to 2014.
I am delighted that your report fully supports the principle of mutual recognition.
It is thanks to the principle of mutual recognition that the Union has achieved major successes, including the European arrest warrant, and all this is a blueprint for a true area of criminal justice.
The report also deals with the issues faced in implementing the principle of mutual recognition, and it is true that the transposition and the full and consistent application of the many existing instruments that are based on the principle of mutual recognition must be monitored.
It is also true, though, that there can be no mutual recognition unless the mutual trust between Member States' legal authorities increases.
That really is the main ingredient of mutual recognition.
I am therefore grateful to the European Parliament for advocating the creation of a truly common judicial culture, as you have just said, Mrs Pagano.
You have rightly insisted on the development of training for the legal professions, of training in the European mechanisms, of relationships with the Court of Justice, of the use of instruments of mutual recognition, of legal cooperation and of comparative law.
On this point, I fully agree with your report, as I believe that, in the Stockholm Programme, the training of judges and the exchange of judges among Member States will be the key to the future of this European area of law that we so want.
Obviously, the Justice Forum, which is a meeting place for the various networks of legal professionals, will also be used to play an essential role in raising practitioners' awareness of the European dimension of their activities and, with the Union's help, these practitioners will have to cooperate to ensure a true exchange of best practice.
The Commission also agrees with the report's proposal - really, thank you - for an assessment mechanism which will not be restricted merely to the transposition of the Union's instruments, but which will also cover more generally the state of justice in the Member States.
It will assess its effectiveness, its speed, and respect for guarantees of defence.
On this issue, work has already begun with the idea, put forward by the justice minister of the Netherlands, of creating an assessment mechanism to measure how the judiciary is operating, in terms of respect for the principles of the rule of law, using, of course, the existing apparatus and bringing added value in terms of political monitoring.
These assessments will allow recommendations to be made.
In addition, the Commission is in favour of increased European Parliament involvement in its assessment mechanisms.
Mr Deprez, this would be an opportunity to include Parliament in the work of the expert groups that we will be putting in place this year and in coming years.
Next, you mentioned the transposition of the new Eurojust decision.
Here too we agree with the approach suggested in the report, on the usefulness of an implementation plan and of meetings of experts with the Member States.
It is thanks to these things that we will be able to implement the new Eurojust decision quickly.
Finally the report insists on the judicious use of new technologies.
The European e-justice strategy was launched to exploit the potential of information and communication technologies in the field of justice.
There you have it, I can only thank the European Parliament for its work and for the deliberations it has shared with us in this area.
I am also convinced that, together, we will succeed in building this criminal justice area, this area of law which should characterise a community of citizens which quite rightly have the right to enjoy quality justice, in whichever Member State they find themselves.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to speak on these three important legislative proposals, and am grateful to the rapporteurs for the extensive work which has gone into their reports.
I would like first to comment on the first two proposals, and then to turn to the third proposal on the issue of the further development of criminal justice within the EU.
The objective of the two proposals covered by the reports from Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez is to establish a procedure which will allow the Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries on aspects of judicial cooperation in civil matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community.
The first proposal, subject to the codecision procedure, covers applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations.
The second, subject to the consultation procedure, covers certain matters in the area of family law.
I would like to underline that the procedure put in place by the two future regulations is devised in such a way as to ensure the integrity of Community law.
Before authorising the negotiation of an agreement, the Commission will check that the envisaged agreement does not render Community law ineffective or undermine the proper functioning of the system established by its rules.
The Commission will also check that the envisaged agreement does not undermine external relations policy as decided by the Community.
It could in fact be argued that, by making it possible for Member States to negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries that are compatible with Community law, the range of operation of Community law is extended to countries outside the European Union.
The procedure established by the two proposals will apply primarily to the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between a Member State and third countries.
It will in certain cases, however, also apply to the negotiation and conclusion of regional agreements between more than one Member State and/or more than one third country.
As far as regional agreements are concerned, the procedure established by the proposal in the area of the family law will apply to the amendment or renegotiation of two already-existing conventions between the Nordic States.
In the proposal in the area of applicable law, only a few regional arrangements will in fact fall within its scope.
These could cover, for example, the operation of an airport situated in a border area, waterways common to two or more countries, or cross-border bridges and tunnels.
The procedure established in the two proposals is based on a high degree of trust and cooperation between the Member States and the Commission.
A mechanism is provided to deal with those situations where the Commission, on the basis of its assessment, reaches the conclusion that the negotiation or conclusion of an agreement should not be authorised.
In such situations, the Member State concerned and the Commission will enter into discussions with the aim of finding a solution together.
The Presidency, on behalf of the Council, hopes and expects that it will be possible to reach a first reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law.
Constructive negotiations have taken place between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, during which the three institutions have together managed to solve a number of difficult issues.
As the proposal in the area of applicable law is largely identical to the proposal in the area of family law, it goes without saying that the amendments made to the first proposal have been taken over in the second proposal, even though that proposal is not subject to the codecision procedure.
It is, in the interest of good law-making, highly desirable to maintain parallelism between the two texts.
I would like to conclude with a few comments on Parliament's recommendation on the development of EU criminal justice, which is the subject of the report by Ms Pagano.
The Council very much agrees on the importance of mutual recognition as a cornerstone of judicial cooperation within the EU.
We consider that it should both be broadened - by adopting other legal instruments in the future - and deepened, through a more effective implementation of the mutual recognition instruments adopted so far.
In this context, the Council would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that it is in the process of finalising the fourth round of mutual evaluations on the practical implementation of the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States.
Within the context of this series of mutual evaluations, experts have also been studying the issues related to interaction between, on the one hand, the European arrest warrant, and, more generally, the principle of mutual recognition, and, on the other hand, the proportionality principle.
However, the proportionality principle also has to be balanced with another principle, which is equally dear to Parliament - namely that of subsidiarity.
The reality is that judicial authorities in various Member States have differing views on what constitutes a serious offence.
The Council looks forward to further work with Parliament and the Commission on the establishment of a system of horizontal and continuous evaluation and implementation of EU policies and legal instruments.
On the issue of judicial training, the Council shares Parliament's opinion that there is a need to foster a genuine EU judicial culture by, inter alia, promoting direct exchanges between judges, prosecutors and members of the judicial staff of different Member States, and to actively develop the European Judicial Training Network.
The Council also shares Parliament's view on the need for a swift and effective implementation of the new Eurojust and Europol decisions.
By way of conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for the extensive and detailed work which has gone into the three reports before us this afternoon.
Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, it is certainly not on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but more so on behalf of my group that I would like to take advantage of this brief moment to express my extraordinarily positive reaction to Mrs Pagano's report.
Congratulations on your report, Mrs Pagano.
I believe that, in writing this report, you have drawn up an extraordinarily detailed list of items that should figure prominently, Commissioner, in the Stockholm Programme, which I know the Commission is actively preparing.
Allow me, beyond what has already been said about the importance of assessing the training of judges, to highlight two issues that are fundamental to the question of mutual trust and which are at the root of what in future could become mutual recognition.
Firstly, the independence of the judiciary.
At present, a number of the EU Member States do not have a judiciary that is independent of the political power or other powers.
This is a scandal, and this scandal must stop.
Secondly, procedural guarantees.
As long as we cannot be sure that, in some countries, people who are suspected or accused of having committed certain types of offences enjoy procedural guarantees similar to those that exist in other countries, it will be difficult to gain broad acceptance for the principle of mutual recognition.
This is a fundamental issue that I wished to introduce into this debate.
Congratulations, Mrs Pagano.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) The national boundaries drawn after the Second World War divided communities and families.
I would like to tell you about an example of this close to us here in Europe.
Szelmenc was at one time part of Hungary.
However, one part of it, Nagyszelmenc, is currently located on the territory of a European Union Member State, Slovakia, while the other part, Kisszelmenc, is in Ukraine.
Before 23 December 2005 there was not even a border crossing between the two villages.
For 60 years parents, children and relatives lived completely separated from each other so that they could not meet for decades.
The EU gave them the eagerly awaited opportunity to end this situation by opening a border crossing.
The example just mentioned is only one of many hundreds or thousands, providing at the same time a powerful argument as to why we are discussing this report now.
The draft regulation provides a procedure on the jurisdiction to be applied between Member States and third countries in relation to matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations.
The regulation will not supersede Community laws, but is only to be applied when the relevant Member State demonstrates that there is a specific interest based on economic, geographical, cultural or historical relations, especially between the Member State and the third country in question, in signing a bilateral sectoral agreement with the third country.
At the same time, the Commission states that the proposed agreement only has a limited influence on the uniform and consistent application of existing Community regulations and on the operation of the system implemented on the basis of the regulations mentioned.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, for taking on this important subject influencing the lives of citizens living both inside and outside the EU, especially because this document achieves a balance between the legal jurisdiction of Community institutions and that of national states.
Mr President, I believe that the proposals for regulations that have been submitted to us by the Commission are important and necessary and, on the other hand, it was also important and necessary for us in the European Parliament to insist on the principle that has been insisted upon by the two rapporteurs, Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez, which is the principle of Community competence.
This is an issue of Community competence on which, for practical reasons, it is advisable to maintain certain responsibilities to be exercised by the Member States, but, as Mr Barrot said, these should be restricted in terms of scope and also time.
There is no option to decline to exercise Community competence, and neither the Council, the Commission nor Parliament has the power to waive these Community competences.
Having established this - this is an exceptional procedure - I believe that the amendments that we have debated and tabled, and which I believe will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow, will make it possible to adopt this package of measures at first reading.
I also hope, however, that on the part of the Commission, in the next stage and going forward, we can progress with the development of a real European system of private law.
This is becoming increasingly necessary, as pointed out, for example, by Mr SÃ³gor in the previous speech.
We are talking about problems that affect people most directly and, to the extent that we are able to resolve their problems, people will realise that the European Union has a function.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to congratulate my fellow Members, Mr Deprez and Mr Zwiefka, and to thank the Commission and the Council for their willingness to work together with us on this issue.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Pagano for her excellent report and her cooperation in drafting compromise amendments which took in, for instance, some of my suggestions.
I think the European Parliament is putting down a firm marker regarding its ambitions for a European criminal justice area in the future, with the twin ambition of bringing criminals to justice and upholding the rights of defendants and victims.
The report rightly highlights key issues like the need for monitoring implementation of legislation; boosting the training of judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers; and new legislation ensuring procedural safeguards, as GÃ©rard Deprez has emphasised.
The European arrest warrant is an effective instrument for bringing criminals to justice, and I strongly regret that the British Conservatives opposed it.
However, we must ensure - and governments must ensure - that European arrest warrants are not misused for trivial issues, like pursuing people who stole a pig or did not pay a hotel bill.
Nor must it be abused for fishing expeditions for questioning, rather than the proper focus on return for charge and prosecution.
The European arrest warrant - as others have said - and the whole of criminal justice is based on mutual trust.
So the Member States must show they deserve that trust by having high-quality legal systems and respecting, for instance, the European Convention on Human Rights and Strasbourg court judgements.
We cannot have people returned, via European arrest warrants, to an EU country who are then sent back to a third country for torture.
If defiance of Strasbourg happens, then the fundamental rights safeguards in the European arrest warrant must be invoked.
I think EU governments have ducked the challenge of tackling substantive disparities in legal systems and the patchy respect for fair trial and human rights.
We must also try and ensure that the quality of criminal justice legislation is better in the future.
Hopefully, after Lisbon - I am delighted the Czech Senate has ratified the Lisbon Treaty - we will have fewer press launches of Member State proposals which go nowhere and then, even if they are approved, are never properly implemented.
EU-wide justice and high legal standards are crucial for our citizens when they travel, work and set up businesses in other countries and when people have to try and explain themselves in a foreign language.
It is high time that we made sure that anyone caught up in the criminal justice system of another Member State was made aware of their rights and obtained proper legal assistance, interpretation and translation.
Finally, I am very disappointed that the UK Government was one of those that blocked a procedural rights measure. I hope they are going to change their minds in the future.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am partly in agreement with the three reports we are discussing.
Mr Zwiefka's report is easier to swallow because it makes the procedure for negotiating and concluding bilateral agreements on sectoral aspects between Member States and non-EU countries homogeneous and, all things considered, more transparent.
As for Mr Deprez's report, I essentially agree with the second half, when it refers to the necessary consistency required of the Commission if we intend to develop a Community policy concerning external relations in the judicial co-operation sector.
However, when it comes the possibility of the Member States concluding the agreements themselves, as a nationalist I am of course pleased with this and hope that it is not a process that is necessarily limited in scope and time.
Lastly, I must honestly say that I have some doubts about Mrs Pagano's European Parliament recommendation.
I am grateful to her for having pointed out and supported the use of e-justice, all the more so because I was responsible for drawing up the report, and I still owe a debt of gratitude to those who co-operated to ensure its success.
However, my awareness of subjects concerning the fundamental freedoms of victims, and also of suspects and defendants, as well as the need to implement the judicial training of judges and operators, lead me to remark that we still have a long way to go in this area - at least we certainly do in Italy.
Furthermore, when it comes to the European arrest warrant, frankly my doubts turn into outright opposition.
I nevertheless thank the rapporteurs for having worked on these subjects with skill and precision.
(EL) Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the three rapporteurs, Mr Zwiefka, Mr Deprez and Mrs Pagano.
Î should like in particular to congratulate Mrs Pagano on her report as shadow rapporteur and to thank her for her kind words and, at the same time, to thank her for working in close cooperation with me on the report.
I should also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that, according to the Commissioner, the Commission accepts almost all the points included in this report.
As such, I fully endorse Mrs Pagano's report and, of course, everything she said in the House today.
Commissioner, 10 years have passed since the European Council announced at Tampere that it had adopted the strategic objective of creating an area of freedom, justice and security in the European Union, 10 years since the announcement that the cornerstone of judicial cooperation is mutual recognition of and trust in decisions by supreme courts.
I must say that little has been done in this direction.
Thus, whereas in the case of civil law, several issues have been promoted, in the case of criminal law, things have remained almost at a standstill.
We hope that, with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, there will be greater progress in this direction.
Commissioner, even this proposal on minimum procedural safeguards has not been pushed forward and our request - and these words are also directed at the Council - is that you push it forward.
I shall close by saying that there are, of course, differences between judicial systems, but there is also room for convergence.
That is why the recommendation on the creation of a committee of wise persons to study all the differences and similarities in the law needs to be implemented, so that we have specific expert recommendations on the convergence of our laws and mutual trust in judicial systems.
(PL) Mr President, in the field of civil justice, apart from the acquis communautaire, there are a number of bilateral agreements which were concluded by Member States with third countries.
Pursuant to Article 307 of the EC Treaty, Member States need to eliminate all provisions which may be present in agreements of this kind and which are incompatible with the acquis.
In its Opinion 1/03 of February 2006, the Court of Justice held that the Community has acquired exclusive competence to conclude international agreements with third countries on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
The question then arises as to whether all existing or proposed bilateral agreements with these countries and on these matters should be replaced by Community agreements.
Or should Member States remain authorised to conclude these agreements where there is no Community interest involved?
This procedure, which is an exception to the rule, must, however, be subject to very specifically stated conditions relating to the scope of the mechanism and the time when it is in force.
It is, therefore, important that the Commission establish a strategy and set priorities, bearing in mind the development of Community policy concerning external relations in the area of judicial cooperation on civil and commercial matters.
Mr President, I will be brief because I can only express the satisfaction I feel about the way in which Parliament has helped to shed light on this area of law, justice, security and freedom that we wish to build in the Union; I welcome all that has been said, especially on the principle of mutual recognition, which itself brings us back to mutual trust between judges.
It is true, as has been explained very well, that there is scope for convergence of the judicial systems, which, in particular, should be formalised through minimum procedures in the case of criminal proceedings.
I really believe that all this is paving the way for a good Stockholm Programme, and I would like to thank Parliament for that.
As for the rest, I can confirm that it will indeed be possible to find an institutional framework for bilateral agreements, but that the Community and the Commission must have exclusive competence.
That is what I am able to say.
I do not wish to prolong the debate.
There are still many things to be said.
Above all I am grateful to Parliament, and I must say - as I will not get to speak again - that I will have been greatly enriched by my experience as commissioner, insofar as I really feel that a good alliance between the Commission and the European Parliament can often - I apologise to the Presidency for pointing this out, but it is the truth - highlight and promote the general European interest.
However, I am of course grateful to the Presidency for having given its support.
There must be synergy between the three institutions; however, my thanks go to the European Parliament which, again this evening, has just given us a very good report.
Thank you, Mrs Pagano.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, this debate has been extremely interesting, and it seems that we are very close to reaching a first-reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law.
May I say there is not just agreement, but a fair and well-balanced agreement.
This is, I think, an excellent illustration of the good cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
I am convinced that Member States will make good use of the procedure established by both the future regulations, and it will allow them to provide an adequate legal framework for their relations with certain third countries with which they have specific ties.
As I stressed earlier, the first-reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law has an impact on the other proposal in the area of family law, given that the two texts are largely identical.
Through the first-reading agreement we have, therefore, also paved the way for an early adoption of the other proposal.
This is indeed a desirable development.
A great many Member States have a huge interest in being able to conclude agreements with third countries on family law matters, such as custody of children, access rights and maintenance obligations due to, for instance, specific historical or social ties with those countries.
Finally, on behalf of the Council, I would like to thank Parliament for its inspiring recommendations on the development of EU criminal justice, which are the subject of the report by Mrs Maria Grazia Pagano.
I would like to thank Parliament for this fruitful debate and for the excellent outcome.
Mr President, when we began this work we were aware that we were walking on thin ice.
On the one hand there was the exceptional nature and unusual importance of the legal instruments upon which we were working.
On the other hand there was an awareness of the passing of time and the unavoidable approach of the end of this term of the European Parliament, and thirdly and finally there was an expectation, both from the Member States and from the citizens of the European Union, that at least at some precisely specified time there would be help available for them to resolve matters which are for them so very difficult and at the same time so important.
It was only thanks to our will to achieve a good result, while of course retaining full respect for Community law, and our will to develop an instrument which will fit into the legal system of the EU, and thanks to our desire to work well together, that we could reach the stage at which we are closing the debate today, which will probably lead to our achieving success at first reading.
Therefore I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to Mr Deprez for his strenuous efforts at stopping us from crossing certain barriers.
I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Kohout for the unusually dynamic work of the representatives of the Czech Presidency, and to Commissioner Barrot for the truly perfect cooperation of the representatives of the Commission.
I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who have spoken here today and who throughout the period of our work contributed to its final success, and also our coworkers, especially all the staff of the Committee on Legal Affairs, who put a truly huge amount of heart and hard work into the final success.
Mr President, I will not need two minutes.
I believe - in response to what I took to be a call from the Council and a wish of Mr Zwiefka - that, as we have worked well together, so far as it depends on me, we will have an agreement at first reading tomorrow.
Therefore in the voting instructions that I shall give to my political friends, I will advise them to vote for the text of the agreement that we have negotiated with the Council and the Commission, irrespective, I might add, of my personal feelings and of the improvements that I would have liked to have made to this text.
That said, Mr President, since I have a bit of time left, I would like to use it not to speak any longer about our reports, but to tell the minister how happy I am that, today, the Czech Senate has given its agreement to the Treaty of Lisbon.
I think that, beyond the work that we have done, that is the good news, the main piece of good news, of the day.
(Applause)
I thank all those who have laboured on this, because we all know that the circumstances have not been easy.
There were strong opposing winds in your country.
The latest political events did not necessarily make things easier, and I would therefore like you to pass on our gratitude, both to the authorities and to the people of your country.
Today you have served the European cause well!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Council for supporting the principles and, above all, if he will allow me, Commissioner Barrot, with whom I have had very profitable exchanges that have been extremely useful in the work that we have subsequently brought to the Chamber.
I would also like warmly to thank those Members who worked on this report, giving me ideas and, of course, bringing all their experience to bear, first and foremost Mr Demetriou, Mrs Ludford and the excellent Mr Deprez.
I wanted to say that Mr Demetriou, Mrs Ludford and Mr Deprez hit the nail on the head; they identified the challenge faced by the European Union, because achieving a collective European judicial culture - which of course means seriously combating the factors mentioned by Mr Deprez - establishing the independence of the judiciary, providing guarantees and ironing out the disparities between the various judicial systems are the challenges that await us.
I nevertheless believe that the work we have done allows us to be optimistic.
I would like to say to Mr Romagnoli - I say this from my own point of view, which ought to be his too - that, essentially, because of the way in which the situation is viewed, there definitely is pessimism in Italy, but we must be willing to be optimistic, and the work that you too, Mr Romagnoli, have done and the contribution that you have made to the report means that, together, we can build the European Union, and the European Union is a reality for we Italians as well.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.

Award of the Sakharov Prize (Formal sitting)
Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, for almost two decades the European Parliament has been awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to men and women from all parts of the world who campaign for human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of expression.
I am delighted to bid a very warm welcome today, here in the European Parliament, to the winner of the Sakharov Prize for 2007, Salih Mahmoud Osman.
(Applause)
It also gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to his wife, Salwa Ahmed Faragalla Ali, who has always stood by his side at difficult times in his life.
We welcome you among us.
(Applause)
The decision to award the 2007 Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman was taken unanimously by the Conference of Presidents, which comprises the chairs of the political groups, on the basis of a proposal adopted by a large number of Members of the European Parliament from various groups.
The European Parliament has thereby reaffirmed its solidarity with the people in Darfur and its conviction that a sustainable solution for that region can only be achieved through justice, democracy and respect for human rights.
The conflict that has plagued Darfur since 2003 is exacerbating the plight of a country devastated by more than twenty years of civil war.
As with most conflicts, it is the civilian population who have suffered most from militia raids, the destruction of villages, scorched-earth policies and forcible displacements.
The conflict has claimed at least 400 000 lives and has been responsible for more than two and a half million displaced persons and refugees, notwithstanding the signing of the peace agreement in Darfur in 2006.
Just like the European Parliament, the winner of the 2007 Sakharov Prize does not simply accept this unjust situation but protests against the impunity of those who caused it.
For years Salih Mahmoud Osman has been defending the rights of victims of the conflict in Darfur.
Thousands of people who have been imprisoned without trial, tortured and exposed to death threats, who have been driven from their homes, displaced or subjected to sexual violence are familiar with the name of Salih Mahmoud Osman.
His commitment is remarkable in several respects.
In a country where violence is constantly on the increase, Salih Osman risks his life on a daily basis in the cause of human dignity and justice.
In the name of human dignity, Salih Osman reassures those destitute, defenceless and intimidated men and women who have sunk into oblivion that the world is aware of their suffering, that they have not been forgotten and that they have reason to hope for a return to a perfectly normal and simply human life.
Since 2004, Salih Osman has been committing himself to the establishment and administration of the Amal Centre in Nyala, amal being Arabic for 'hope', for the rehabilitation of victims of violence and sexual abuse.
In a predominantly Muslim country, Salih Osman is one of the few men who campaign actively in support of women's rights and especially for recognition of the right to compensation for victims of sexual violence.
In the name of justice, Salih Osman strives, day after day, to ensure that those responsible for war crimes are held to account both nationally and internationally.
While the Sudanese judicial system still has many defects that make it unable to put an end to the prevailing climate of lawlessness within the country, international jurisdiction seems to offer an alternative.
The fact that the Sudanese authorities are refusing to hand over alleged war criminals to the International Criminal Court, however, highlights the limits of international justice and shows how much progress is still needed before the rule of law can be established in Darfur and throughout Sudan.
That is why Salih Osman's work is not confined to the legal aid he gives the victims.
As a member of the Opposition in the Sudanese Parliament since 2005, he does not hesitate to affirm his convictions in the Sudanese political arena and to engage in efforts to bring about genuine reform of the legal system.
At the meeting between the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament on the eve of last weekend's EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon, I had the opportunity and the great pleasure to meet Salih Osman.
I was immediately impressed by his strong personality and his unbending will to fight for human rights in spite of all the persecution and hostility to which he and his family have been subjected.
I learned a short while ago that Ali and you have three children, who are also very much in our thoughts today.
In 2004 Salih Osman himself was imprisoned for seven months without being charged, and it was only when he went on hunger strike that he was released.
Members of his family have been tortured and murdered or have had their houses set on fire by the militias.
The great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote, 'Knowing is not enough; we must apply.
Willing is not enough; we must do'.
Salih Osman embodies that kind of will and determination, showing his courage in his daily struggle on behalf of his fellow human beings.
He is an exemplary campaigner for greater respect for the rule of law in his region.
Salih Mahmoud Osman, you have our firm support and our warm acclaim.
As you know, the European Parliament has always been particularly receptive to the suffering of the African peoples.
Salih Osman is one of a number of African prizewinners to whom Parliament has given its support in past years and whom it continues to support.
Nelson Mandela was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1988, Salima Ghezali in 1997, Dom Zacarias Kamwenho in 2001 and Hauwa Ibrahim in 2005.
Salih Osman, we congratulate you on your untiring work in this cause, in this spirit, and we hope that the recognition this prize brings might grant you strength and protection from year to year for as long as your struggle continues.
We are at your side.
(Applause)
Sudanese lawyer acting for the victims of the war in Darfur. - Mr President, thank you for this tremendous honour.
This prize is awarded as a unanimous vote of the European Parliament - a fact which gives me great satisfaction, but more importantly one which gives me the opportunity to speak to you today.
I am a native of Darfur, born in Jebel Marra, which is a mountainous region located in the centre of Darfur State.
I have worked as a lawyer in Darfur in Sudan for many years.
I have been a victim of detention and torture because of my work.
Members of my own family have been tortured and displaced by the militia in Darfur.
For many years, in my work, I have represented thousands of people who needed my help in front of the Courts.
I have seen thousands of people who have been tortured; I have seen hundreds of women and young girls who have been victims of sexual abuse; I have seen the four million who have been forcibly displaced from their homes and those two and a half million who are confined, as we speak now, in the camps around the cities of Darfur: Nyala, Al Fashir, Zalingi and Al Geneina.
The UN Security Council has adopted several resolutions related to the situation in Darfur. Unfortunately, none of these has been implemented effectively.
The victims feel disappointed.
They are waiting to hear from you; from the people of Europe.
Your leaders have been talking tough about the policies of the Sudanese Government in Darfur. But so far we have not seen any concrete steps to address the situation in a strong and targeted manner.
As a representative of the victims of the conflict, today I have an unprecedented opportunity to speak directly to the leaders of Europe.
The people of Darfur need the European Union to show a strong, united position regarding protection of innocent civilians.
The people of Darfur ask you to protect them from the violence, killings and abuse they are forced to face on a daily basis.
The people of Darfur want you to protect their children and women from acts of rape and sexual violence, which are being used as 'weapons of war'.
This protection can be made possible through the deployment of the UN-AU hybrid force.
The involvement of international, and especially European, forces is imperative, even though the Government of Sudan may be unwilling to accept that at the present moment.
But Europe has a role to play in putting more pressure on the Government of Sudan to facilitate the deployment of these troops and the protection of the people of Darfur.
Now, in Darfur, and in Sudan, I tell you there will be no peace without justice and without protection.
Peace can also be facilitated by Europe.
The European Union has a great responsibility to promote peace internationally.
The leaders of Europe have the ability to lead the peace process also in Sudan.
I ask you to increase your efforts in bringing the rebel groups and the Government of Sudan to the table of peace negotiations as a matter of urgency.
But the fact is that rebel groups are splitting among themselves, and this does not help the situation in Darfur.
I want you to think about taking on board other stakeholders: the millions of victims who are voiceless in the camps and other, directly affected people of Darfur.
Take on board also the civil society movement, NGOs and community leaders.
That would help the situation in Darfur.
Even if we can provide protection and promote peace in Darfur, justice and accountability must not be compromised by any political deal.
Presently, none of the victims can return to their houses or homes, because of the absence or lack of security.
Not only are our communities being attacked by militias, but even helicopter gunships of the Government of Sudan are destroying our villages in aerial bombardments.
Despite these serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice, because the Sudanese judicial system is incapable, incompetent and unwilling to provide justice.
All the perpetrators are beyond the reach of our domestic justice.
This conflict is one which is marked by a culture of total impunity.
As a lawyer, and a native of Darfur, I know that there can never be a lasting peace in the region without justice.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has made some important and significant steps in promoting accountability.
Yet, the cycle of impunity has not yet been broken.
The people of Darfur ask you to support the work of the ICC.
The ICC is the most competent international criminal tribunal which can make the many notorious perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable for their actions.
Right now, the two identified suspects Kosheib and Haroun are still beyond the reach of justice.
The Government of Sudan is insisting that it will never hand them over to the ICC.
Darfur is not the only region of Sudan which suffers from abuses of human rights. Indeed, citizens from every part of Sudan face daily restrictions on their freedom of expression, freedom of association and other basic rights that many people in Europe take for granted.
I urge you, also, to encourage and promote the rule of law in my country, so that all citizens of Sudan can enjoy their individual and collective rights.
In the light of the upcoming elections in 2009, we must ensure that free and fair elections take place, and that a free and fair result will be respected by all sides.
Lastly, I would like to thank you, the Members of the European Parliament, who came to Sudan in June of this year to see with your own eyes what I have described.
This was a visit coordinated by the office of the European Commission in Khartoum.
The office of the European Commission has been a source of great support and a partner to me in my work for many years now.
The recognition of the European Commission and of you, the European Parliament, for the work of human rights defenders in Sudan gives us the courage and determination to continue to speak for the victims, and relieve some of their suffering.
In conclusion, I am proud to accept this honour on behalf of the other candidates to this prize: the Russian journalist assassinated last year, Anna Politkovskaya; the Chinese dissidents, Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia; and the Afghani MP and women's rights activist, Joya Malalai, and also on behalf of so many Sudanese who believe - as I do - in human dignity and the pursuit of justice.
Thank you so much.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to stand, or remain standing, for the European anthem in honour of Salih Osman.
Combating female genital mutilation in the EU (short presentation)
The next item is the report by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on combating female genital mutilation in the EU.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is particularly fitting that Commissioner Michel is taking part in our debate.
As we know, he always pays great attention to human rights issues and tragedies in Africa.
In fact, Mr Michel's presence gives me hope that the Commission may give serious consideration to an issue that today not only affects 28 African countries and various countries in the Middle East and neighbouring countries, but is now a particularly distressing problem within the European Union itself.
The mass immigration that has taken place in recent years has brought this tragedy to EU countries.
Tens of thousands of girls and young women are at risk every day of suffering a terrible practice that injures them irreversibly from a physical point of view, but also does extremely serious psychological damage.
That is why - although Parliament has already condemned this practice on several occasions in previous years and in fact gave funding through DAPHNE to 14 projects to combat female genital mutilation - that is why today we again find ourselves discussing this topic, because the phenomenon has unfortunately not become less prevalent, but remains on the increase.
We must have the courage to adopt a more appropriate serious method of prevention through cultural campaigns able to make immigrant women, but also the fathers of these girls, understand that following a tribal rite, which has nothing to do with religion, is no way to integrate or create a future for their daughters.
Consider a girl who attends a French, Italian or Belgian school and suddenly, after having socialised with her peers, finds herself snatched from normality and forced to suffer a tragedy that will mark her for life.
This girl is not only physically mutilated, but it is impossible for her to resume a normal relationship with other people; she feels diminished, different, and in our society we do not want people who are different.
We want people who, no matter what their religion, skin colour or geographical origin, can work together to build a better Europe, closer to its citizens.
For this reason, Mr President, Commissioner, we as Parliament - and I would like to thank all my colleagues from the committee who helped me draft this report - want the laws of all Member States to be harmonised so that female genital mutilation is classed as an offence.
We do not want palliative proposals such as 'pricking'.
We want women to be truly equal with men; we do not want initiation rites, but real integration instead.
We want NGOs to be able to carry out their work, we want a prevention policy that involves immigrant women's associations, we want to punish anybody who seeks to mutilate girls and drag them into a perverse spiral of desperation and marginalisation.
The report covers many areas and I think Members have had the opportunity to examine and evaluate it.
I believe everyone should join in this call for a purposeful Europe that combines the efforts of its three institutions to combat this horrible crime that violates human rights.
Mr President, both on my own and my colleague's behalf, I would like to thank Mrs Muscardini for her speech, as I believe that she has put her finger on what is both a tragedy and a scandal.
I would really like to thank Mrs Muscardini for her excellent report on this major issue of the fight against female genital mutilation in the European Union.
The European Commission has very clearly denounced, both within the Union and in third countries, the unacceptable nature of traditional practices that seriously undermine the fundamental right of women and young girls to respect for their physical and mental integrity.
We are obviously in full agreement with the report.
We think that all the Member States of the European Union should take strong measures.
I would say much stronger measures should be taken to put an end to these practices, both within the European Union and in third countries, because it is totally unacceptable and quite incredible that this can still go on within the European Union.
We must also ensure, in the framework of all the political dialogues that we hold with third countries, that the latter fully understand our position.
I would like to move away from the text for a moment to say that I can assure you that this issue is always on the agenda in all the political dialogues that we hold with developing countries.
Just recently, President CompaorÃ© of Burkina Faso called me and said that they were just about to adopt a law to prohibit these practices, although this will be no easy matter.
It should be pointed out that there are obviously some clans and some tribes that still carry on this practice, and it is quite a sensitive subject in the country, but he really had a desire to make progress and that, I believe, is important.
You will also be aware that the Commission regularly releases Community funding to support projects in Europe and third countries that aim to prevent and eradicate female genital mutilation and to give help to the victims and young girls at risk.
In Europe, our main instrument is the DAPHNE III programme, which supports European non-governmental organisations and local and regional public institutions and authorities in their fight against female genital mutilation.
Since its launch in 1997, DAPHNE has cofinanced 14 projects specifically dedicated to this issue, providing a total amount of around EUR 2.4 million.
The DAPHNE projects have enabled us to implement community training and support programmes, to carry out awareness campaigns, to analyse national legislation, to gather information and statistics, to develop tools and to establish best practices for use by the actors on the ground, and to recommend policy directions to European and national decision makers.
We are evidently determined to maintain our support for such actions and to continue to deal with the issue within the European Union, not only in the context of violence prevention and victim support, but also in the areas of immigration, asylum and criminal justice.
I am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment.
I have to tell you that I am somewhat shocked by a certain kind of cowardice on the part of our governments and some politicians who consider this to be part of culture and therefore untouchable.
I am sorry: the minimum we should expect of people who come to Europe is that they comply with the rules in force.
I believe that there can be no two-speed justice; there can be no concept of two speeds.
This has no effect on the capacity of a European country to welcome incomers, rather the contrary.
This is a debate that I myself have experienced in my own country in the past.
I must say that I am shocked that some people, on the pretext of respecting the culture of migrants, basically refuse to penalise this type of thing.
I think that if we want at least to sort out this issue within Europe, we must reach the stage where we penalise these practices.
We need to have this political courage, and I do not think that it would hamper a country's ability to welcome incomers if we were to say: 'This is our constitution, these are our rules, these are our human values, and you must comply with them.
If you do not comply with them, you will be acting outside the law and you will be punished.'
That is the end of my aside, but I am glad I have said these things because I fully share your irritation regarding this issue.
In the framework of its external aid to third countries, the Commission is also applying three policies to combat female genital mutilation.
First of all, as I told you, it is making the issue of the emancipation of women, their human rights and their health an integral part of any political and strategic dialogue it conducts with the partner governments.
Secondly, it is supporting actions that argue and lobby for improved national legislation as well as for the creation of national policies suitable for promoting and protecting women's rights and for banning all harmful practices.
Thirdly, it is supporting initiatives intended to strengthen the scope for action of political leaders, along with awareness campaigns aimed at all sectors of society.
The multiannual Hague Programme, covering the various actions that will be carried out to develop the area of justice, freedom and security, comes to an end in 2010.
We are going to present the new Stockholm programme 2010-2014 in a communication in Spring 2009.
I can confirm to you that this programme will lay great emphasis on the aspect relating to the protection of fundamental rights and of victims, including the promotion and protection of children's and women's rights.
Although the Commission has not yet drawn up a specific strategy for combating female genital mutilation, we are determined to continue our support for actions aimed at preventing it, and we intend to carry on raising this issue within the framework of the Union's internal and external policies.
The presentation is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 24 March 2009.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Each year in Europe, 180 000 migrant women suffer or are at risk from suffering genital mutilation.
It is important to remember that these mutilations constitute a violation of human rights that has very serious physical and psychological consequences.
These practices cannot be justified on the grounds of cultural or religious traditions.
In order to put a stop to them, the Member States must enforce compliance with the prohibition laid down in their criminal law, and the practice of mutilation must be considered a criminal offence.
At the same time, actual or potential victims must be given access to legal and medical assistance.
The EU must increase its support for those NGOs that are doing remarkable work on the ground in the areas of prevention and assistance.
At national and European levels, targeted information and education campaigns would remove the taboos associated with these practices whilst informing families of the criminal consequences of such mutilations.
It is therefore important for the EU to tackle this problem by defining joint preventive actions to prohibit the practice of mutilation in the EU and by referring to this prohibition in all cooperation agreements concluded with third countries.
Genital mutilation is a social problem that concerns us all.

Opening of the sitting
Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 6 March 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday:
No amendments.
Tuesday:
(DE) Mr President, I rise to make the following request: on Tuesday afternoon there is to be a discussion on the Lamfalussy process.
I have heard that Mr McCreevy will be unable to attend.
We must accept that.
The Commission is a collegial body, and any Commissioner can stand in for any other.
I have a high regard for Mrs Fischer Boel as a Commissioner, but would it not be possible in this case to ask Mr Almunia, who is more familiar with the material, to represent the Commission?
Mr President, I believe you have had word that Commissioner Frattini will no longer perform his function as a Commissioner with effect from 14 March.
We observe a certain disparity between the Frattini case and that of Louis Michel, who ceased to perform the duties of his office from the day on which he became an election candidate.
Perhaps, Mr President, you can ask the Commission to inform us why this distinction has been made and to explain why in one case the Commissioner in question ceased to perform his duties on the day he became a candidate, whereas in another case the Commissioner will not relinquish his duties until about a week after his nomination.
That is the request I make on behalf of my group.
I believe there are no objections to the first request, namely that Commissioner Almunia present the Commission's views in that debate.
As for the second request, we shall look into that.
Wednesday:
No amendments.
Thursday:
We have received several requests for the debates on breaches of human rights.
The PPE-DE Group has moved that the second item, on Afghanistan, be replaced by a new item entitled 'Arrests of demonstrators following the presidential elections in Russia'.
(DE) Mr President, this is not an item about the Russian elections themselves but about the fact that, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian elections, demonstrations were broken up by OMON security forces and 50 people were arrested, most of whom are still in custody.
That was a brutal act of aggression, and we take the view that it demands an instant reaction from this Parliament.
(DE) Mr President, we discussed this at last Thursday's meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
I do not believe it serves any purpose to discuss this matter now in isolation.
In the not-too-distant future, in the run-up to the EU-Russia summit, we shall have the opportunity to debate the overall state of relations between the EU and Russia.
This item could be incorporated into that debate.
Accordingly, we have recommended that, instead of consigning it to Thursday afternoon, when only 25 Members are present, we should deal with it as part of the major debate that we already intend to hold.
The delegation from our Parliament is due to visit Russia in a few days' time.
We should await their return and listen to what they have to report.
(Parliament approved the request.)
(FR) Mr President, what has just happened and has made some of my fellow Members laugh is very serious.
Mr Daul, we are talking about a young man of 23, sentenced to death for downloading an article on the rights of women in Islam, in a country that has close ties with the European Union, where our soldiers are defending Afghanistan, with a new constitution that, officially, defends fundamental rights and freedom of expression.
With one voice you have just taken on a responsibility that I hope you will not come sorely to regret.
(Applause)
Let me make the following proposal, Mr Wurtz: I have already written to the President of Afghanistan about this matter, and if you are all in agreement, I shall take the initiative again, not just in my own name but on behalf of the whole House.
May I assume that this is what everyone wants?
In that case, we shall not immerse ourselves any further in this matter, Mr Cohn-Bendit, and I shall launch another initiative on behalf of you all.
I would really like to avoid a debate.
If Mr Schulz wishes to speak, Mr Cohn-Bendit is entitled to address us first.
Does Mr Cohn-Bendit wish to speak?
That is the proper procedure, but I shall not give anyone preferential treatment.
Mr Cohn-Bendit does not wish to make a statement.
What about Mr Schulz?
(DE) Mr President, I do not intend to make a statement.
I should just like to say that I fully share the views expressed by Francis Wurtz.
The decision we took in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday was based in part on the point he has just made.
May I now ask you to let us avail ourselves of the possibility of adding this item to Thursday's agenda?
We now have other matters that we can put on the agenda.
Since I just made an exception for Mr Schulz, I must let Mr Posselt speak again, but please do not let this discussion drag on any further.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Schulz and Mr Wurtz have said.
Our purpose was not to prevent the House from addressing another issue but to put Russia on the agenda.
I would appeal to the chairs of the two main political groups to let us return to the old arrangement whereby we could deal with up to five topics.
The restriction to three items was a mistake, and that is the source of these difficulties.
I must inform those Members who do not yet know about the other requests for inclusion in the agenda that the ALDE and GUE Groups have tabled a joint request for the inclusion of a new item dealing with the case of the Iranian Mehdi Kazemi.
I believe that is also a very urgent matter.
In addition, the PPE-DE Group has also requested that the case of Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho be placed on the agenda.
I must brief you on the subject of formal requests.
We can now vote again on whether to put the case of the Afghan on the agenda, but if that request were approved, it would definitely rule out a vote on the other two topics.
I have to make you aware of that.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Schulz requested that this topic be added to the agenda as an extra item.
If that is not possible, I regret to say we shall have to vote against it.
We would like to put the Iraqi bishop on the agenda as well as supporting Mr Schulz's request.
That, after all, is what he himself was proposing.
We already have two items on the agenda.
A third item may be added.
It can be this one, but it could also be either of the two others that have been requested.
We have agreed on two items, and three more requests are on the table.
Under our Rules of Procedure, we can only put three items on our agenda, which means that we have to choose between the case in Afghanistan, the Iranian case and the Archbishop.
We are bound by that rule.
This is why I asked you whether you were in agreement with the procedure of voting first on the Afghan case.
If that request is approved by a majority, the other two will lapse.
I have to inform you properly of the procedural consequences.
Mr President, I do not see the logic in taking one of them before any of the others, because they are all different; they are all cases which have great merits on their own.
My group, together with the GUE/NGL Group, has proposed that we have a debate on the Iranian homosexual in mortal danger, and I would like to find a way of dealing with this.
I fear that this is what happens when groups do not coordinate and start acting out of order.
We made a clear decision on Russia at the Conference of Presidents last week.
If the cooperation - and there is a lot of it between the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group - cannot manage this in such a way that we do not end up in this mess, then I think the two groups ought to be looking at it.
I think you have got to find a fair way, Mr President, of dealing with these three together.
It is indeed a difficult business, because we can only have three items.
It would also be possible, however, to regard the Afghan and Iranian cases as a single issue of 'individuals facing the threat of death'.
This would leave only one case uncovered, namely that of the Archbishop, which could be addressed in another item.
That, I believe, would certainly be a reasonable approach.
(DE) Mr President, we shall make an exception and support that proposal.
Let me also say to Mr Posselt that his group's request explicitly stated 'instead of Afghanistan'.
Rather than trying to talk one's way out of a tight corner at this stage, it would be better to consider the implications of requests before tabling them, but in this case, Mr President, we can support your compromise.
I do not see any contradiction there, and in the matter of the Archbishop we can choose a procedure through the President of Parliament which also devotes due attention to his cause without our making it an item in the topical and urgent debate.
(Parliament approved the President's proposal.)
(The order of business was thus established.)

Control of the budgetary implementation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (short presentation)
The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Control of the Budgetary Implementation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) in 2007.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to reiterate that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is the Union's new financing instrument for granting pre-accession assistance for the period 2007-2013 and replaces the previous programmes for candidate and potential candidate countries, namely the PHARE, CARDS, ISPA and other programmes.
The new instrument includes five components which cover the priorities defined in accordance with the needs of the beneficiary country, namely transition assistance and institution building, cross-border cooperation, regional development, human resources development and rural development.
This report by Parliament is the first examination of the application of this new instrument and has a twofold objective:
firstly, to bring the project financed more closely into line with pre-accession priorities, especially for the environment, gender equality, nuclear safety and increased employment;
secondly, to avoid the mistakes of the past, such as those belatedly identified in the application of the PHARE, SAPARD and ISPA programmes in Bulgaria and Romania.
We believe that this can be better achieved if Parliament closely monitors the application of the new instrument from the outset, which is why we called for this own-initiative report.
Parliament expresses its satisfaction in this motion for a resolution at the high implementation rate of IPA commitments in 2007 and its regret at the considerable delays both in approving the relevant regulations and implementing the programmes which started in 2008.
We would also point out that the objective of parliamentary control of pre-accession assistance is not only to examine if the funds available were used legitimately, but also to evaluate if they were actually allocated to accession priorities and if the desired results were achieved.
We call in our report for a better balance between projects earmarked for meeting political criteria and projects earmarked for bringing the country into line with the Community acquis and we call for horizontal and regional programmes to be strengthened.
We also call for particular emphasis to be placed on combating corruption, organised crime and unemployment, especially unemployment among young people.
We call for more funds to strengthen women's rights and equal opportunities in general.
We also call for cross-border cooperation to be strengthened, in order to promote reconciliation and good neighbourly relations between beneficiary countries and between them and the Member States of the European Union to a greater degree.
To close, we consider that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries.
However, in order to get the maximum return, it needs to remain firmly in line with accession priorities and the social and political conditions peculiar to each country.
For this reason, Parliament hopes to play a fundamental role in the application and adaptation of this instrument.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank Parliament for giving us the opportunity to comment on the report on the control of budgetary implementation of the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) for 2007, and to extend our thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for the very valuable report that she initiated and prepared.
We can, overall, concur with the findings and recommendations of the report, which are fully in line with the views of the Commission on how best to use financial assistance for the Western Balkans and for Turkey.
The Commission acknowledges the late launch of IPA 2007 programmes because of the late adoption of the legal framework for IPA.
I can assure you, however, that the Commission made all efforts to limit the delay of implementation on the ground, and that preparation of management structures and detailed project design were pushed ahead all through 2008.
Within this framework the Commission will ensure that the impact of IPA will become visible in the beneficiary countries.
Allow me to elaborate on some of the issues raised in the report.
As regards the balance between political criteria and transposition of the acquis communautaire, the Commission has already increased the allocations for projects in the area of the political criteria in IPA 2008 in all countries, and will continue to do so gradually.
However, in the face of the current financial crisis, we will also need to strike an appropriate balance in the 2009 and 2010 programmes between continued support for political reforms and financial assistance to help the countries mitigate the consequences of the economic downturn.
In this regard the report rightly identifies the challenges generated by the financial crisis and the need for an EC response.
To that end, the Commission has put together an IPA crisis response package of about EUR 250 million at the end of 2008 with the aim of leveraging some EUR 600 million in loans from international financial institutions.
Measures will focus on support to private sector SMEs, energy efficiency investments, and support to investments and infrastructure under national IPA programmes in close coordination with international financial institutions.
The Commission also fully concurs with the need to establish the decentralised management system as a step to promoting ownership and responsibility of candidate countries and potential candidates.
Guidance and assistance is being given to them in order for these countries to build the required public management structures and public financial control systems.
According to the principles of IPA, environmental protection, good governance, civil society development, gender equality and non-discrimination are all cross-cutting issues and are an integral part of project design.
Civil society organisations are now more actively involved in the development and the initiation of projects.
In 2008 the Commission launched the civil society facility as a tool for promoting civil society development and advancement of regional cooperation, for which an indicative budget of EUR 130 million is earmarked for 2008-2010.
The Commission also shares the rapporteur's views as regards the importance of education, regional and cross-border cooperation and gender equality, to name but a few issues.
The services of the Commission have fully taken on board the recommendations of Parliament and we look forward to reviewing progress with you during our regular rendezvous where we have the opportunity to discuss the financial assistance strategies and their implementation.
This will allow the further enhancement of the ongoing dialogue between our respective institutions.
The item is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009.

the recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on compliance with the flag state requirements (14288/2/2008 - C6-0484/2008 - (rapporteur: Emanuel Jardim Fernandes).
Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, today, with the ratification of the Erika III package, we are bringing to a close an undertaking that began more than three years ago.
The feeling I have at this moment is certainly one of satisfaction, and I am sure that everyone who has trodden this path with me feels the same.
We are now writing a new chapter in the history of Europe, by making it an area of greater safety on our seas.
The aim of the Erika III package is to protect our seas and, as you are all well aware, its roots lie in the terrible oil slicks from the Erika and the Prestige, which caused severe damage to the coasts of southern Europe.
We have learnt the lessons from our past and realise that we have to act immediately to prevent such things from happening in that way again.
Europe must not underrate the strategic value of maritime transport to its economy: 90% of the European Union's foreign trade goes by sea, as does 40% of our intra-Community trade.
That accounts for all the work that the EU has had to put into the legal framework for maritime transport over several decades.
As I say, it has not been a path strewn with roses: far from it, because, although we were all united by a common goal, the Council's initial miserly attitude made it a difficult journey.
At the same time, to be fair, I would like to praise the firm political will shown by the French Presidency to bring such an important topic to a conclusion.
I also hardly need to stress the decisive role played by Vice-President Tajani, who gave the final push to reach consensus.
Lastly, but no less importantly for all that, I would like to highlight this Chamber's steadfastness in upholding Europe's interests and protecting the citizens whom we represent.
Focusing now on the topic itself, I would like to make a number of comments on each of the proposals that make up the package.
I can tell you right now that most of my concerns have been dispelled.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is one issue that gave me great cause for concern throughout the negotiations, since it touches on an essential aspect of the package.
I am talking about the independent nature of the bodies and authorities created for the purpose of adopting the best possible decisions within the shortest possible time.
I am talking specifically about the independent authority that is to be set up to make what is always a very difficult decision: whether to admit a vessel in distress into a place of refuge.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the final decision that has been adopted.
The way things stand is that each Member State will set up an independent authority with the resources and powers needed to adopt the best possible decisions in the shortest possible time.
Only once a detailed assessment of all the risks has been carried out will the authority finally decide whether to admit the vessel or to send it away.
In this respect, it is proper to acknowledge Mr Sterckx's tenacity in carrying through this difficult undertaking.
I am also pleased at the progress made on the vessel tracking instruments, which are essential for reducing the number of risk situations.
With regard to the report by Mrs Vlasto, whom I congratulate on her excellent work, I would like to highlight the substantial improvement that will be made to the current inspection regime in Community ports, which will become more effective through being based on a risk profile.
I would also like to thank Mr KohlÃ­Äek for his willingness to enter into a dialogue and for the good work he has done.
Another aspect that I would like to highlight is the ambitious proposal in the field of passengers' rights which, until now, have not been regulated in Community law.
This advance was due to Mr Costa's efforts until the very last second.
With regard to the Savary and Fernandes reports, I am delighted that the Council has at last decided to abandon its obstructive position, which was not leading anywhere useful.
This change has enabled us to reach a solution, albeit a minimal one.
At any rate, I have to say I am pleased because the package is now complete.
Lastly, I will move on to my own report.
After being examined by the Council, it has been split into two legal instruments.
The key points of my report can be summarised as follows: with this fourth revision of the Community legislation regulating the activities of inspection bodies, we have succeeded in strengthening the surveillance mechanisms by creating an independent assessment committee with permanent powers and the ability to act on its own initiative.
We have also succeeded in laying down a fairer, more flexible system of sanctions that is also more effective than the one we had before, since it penalises those who do not act as they should, but it does so according to the severity of the infringement committed and the organisation's financial means.
Finally, we have managed to make progress on the very tricky issue of recognition of classification certificates, by setting out the terms on which recognised organisations will have to recognise each other, but without endangering maritime safety, and taking the most stringent rules as our reference in order to safeguard the standards of excellence that characterise our European naval industries.
Mr President, the European Commission published its proposals on the Erika III package on 23 November 2005, and I hope you will allow me to pay tribute at this point to the Commissioner responsible for transport at the time, Jacques Barrot, because, with this new package, he has worked very ambitiously to improve maritime safety in Europe.
The Erika III package puts the finishing touches to an overall legislative effort that has taken 10 years since the tragic shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany.
It has allowed the European Union to plug what were initially some serious loopholes, in order to become an international point of reference when it comes to maritime safety.
In the wake of these disasters, European citizens angered by such maritime disasters had the right to expect politicians to respond firmly and vigorously to put a stop to irresponsible behaviour.
Our ambition was to create an area of responsibility within which each party involved in maritime transport must take its fair share of the responsibility for its choices and actions and, where appropriate, for its errors and mistakes.
The Erika III package thus covers several stages in maritime transport, with true complementarity between the various proposals - it is an overall approach that led us to view each of our reports as forming part of an indivisible whole.
Today, when this House is being asked to give its opinion on the outcome of a conciliation procedure that will bring a conclusion to this long process - more than three years' work - we as rapporteurs are delighted with this joint approach, which has enabled us to achieve what I believe to be a very satisfactory result.
I would like to thank my fellow rapporteurs, who have all considered this general interest before turning to their own individual interests, which has allowed us to achieve, together, a good result that none of us could have achieved individually.
With regard to my own report, Parliament has got what it wanted on almost all the important points in it, firstly because ships will be inspected not only in ports but also at anchorages, as we called for.
This is very important, because it means that ships will not be able to call at locations where they know they will be able to avoid inspections.
Next, we managed to get a very strict regime for conducting inspections: Member States will be able to cooperate to plan the inspections of a following port of call without harming the inspection of high-risk ships, and the interval between inspections of these ships must not be more than six months.
The most pleasing aspect of our negotiations with the Council, however, is that repeated bad behaviour will be punished.
Inspections in our ports may give rise to temporary access refusal measures and to bans on operating in our waters, and possibly even to a permanent ban, in other words, a definitive prohibition on entering European ports and anchorages.
This measure targets hulks.
To achieve this, there will be a tolerance limit - a threshold of unacceptability that cannot be breached, because ships issued with a definitive refusal of access to our ports or anchorages will be designated as hulks, which will have a deterrent effect.
We reached agreement with the Council on this point in conciliation, so the conciliation meeting on 8 December was very positive.
My thanks to the French Presidency of the Council and to Dominique Bussereau, because I am quite sure that it was the personal commitment and all the work done by the Presidency's teams that have enabled us today to submit a very satisfactory result, which I call on Parliament to approve without reservation.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are finishing off a job we started 10 years ago; I still remember clearly the indignation aroused by the accident involving the Erika in December 1999: the speed with which Commissioner de Palacio presented proposals at that time, the cooperation of the Council - which, under pressure from public opinion, was at least partly responsible for ensuring that the first two packages were ready by June 2002 along with, among other things, my report on monitoring and a European policy for the monitoring of ships and for ports of refuge.
I also remember clearly our indignation at the Prestige disaster in November 2002 - incidentally, we were also holding a part-session here in Strasbourg at the time.
Back then, we wondered why we had adopted all those measures if things could go so badly wrong at the application stage.
Parliament played its part back then.
I would remind the House of a report by the Temporary Committee on Improving Safety at Sea, chaired by Mr Jarzembowski, in which we made it clear that, although the regulatory framework was in place at both European and international level, we still had to ensure practical application and follow-up of those rules by people on board ships, in ports and elsewhere in order to ensure that shipping was as safe as possible.
Things still went wrong in places in terms of the practical application of these rules, and the Commission responded to the questions that were asked in the European Parliament at the time with seven proposals by Commissioner Barrot.
I think that these formed a successful whole, and I also wish to thank Commissioner Tajani for following them up.
In my opinion, all this forms a successful whole.
The existing rules are improved and supplemented by two reports, one by Mr Savary and one by Mr Fernandes.
Thus, we have provided a balanced package.
I should like to say a couple of things about my report on vessel traffic monitoring.
An existing network called SafeSeaNet provides a means of exchange, enabling all Member States to talk to one another and exchange information.
All ships must be equipped with AIS, an automatic system that provides information on ships entering European waters, enabling us to locate and contain the risks.
The AIS is also there for the benefit of fishing vessels, improving safety for these vessels, too.
We insist once again - and I think that this is important - that the ship's crew be treated fairly in case of an accident and not erroneously regarded as criminals.
We have also tightened up the arrangement for the accommodation of ships in distress.
We knew already that we needed plans, but now an authority is needed too, one that is not only involved in drawing up these plans but also takes care of their implementation.
The authority needs to have expertise, be competent to take independent decisions and be permanent in nature.
It should be already available, therefore, rather than needing to be put together in a hurry in case of an accident.
Commissioner, we are still awaiting a scheme to compensate ports of refuge for damage, but I am counting on your presenting a proposal on this at the appropriate time.
We have spent 10 years working on this, then.
This time, we are doing so without the pressure of a disaster.
I should like to thank both the Slovenian and French Presidencies, as Mrs Vlasto has already done.
I believe that no decision would have been possible if it were not for them, but I should also like to stress that Parliament has been very tenacious, and has been united in pushing through its positions on many points.
For this I wish to thank all my fellow Members who played a part, the shadow rapporteurs, the rapporteurs and everyone else.
We remember today someone who is no longer with us, but who played a huge role in bringing about this package, and that is Mr Piecyk.
I should like to express my warm thanks to him posthumously.
Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot issue a directive banning accidents, nor one declaring that there will be no more storms at sea, but I think that everything politicians can do to improve maritime safety is currently being done.
Ladies and gentlemen, maritime disasters can be the single most destructive events that occur in the transport sector.
Maritime transport has been connected ever since mythological times with a range of beliefs and traditions.
Until recently, it was managed through various sets of regulations.
Gradually, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has established clearer regulations based, among other things, on customary law.
The establishment of these rules was absolutely not an end in itself.
They have to ensure the safe transport, both of goods and passengers, and they specify the technical requirements for ships and infrastructure and the rules of navigation, inter alia.
Other regulations -among the topics recently discussed in the European Parliament - unify the minimum requirements for crew training.
Others attempt to exclude the possibility of maritime disasters occurring.
However, despite all technical measures, large-scale accidents can occur.
Until the Prestige tanker disaster, the countries of the European Union were unaware of the need for a thorough unification of accident technical investigations in the branch of maritime transport.
The inability to investigate the Prestige disaster or to identify clear causes of the accident showed the need for investigation methods to be unified.
This includes the establishment of fixed deadlines for commencing and completing investigations and a structure for the final reports.
The establishment of objective investigatory commissions clearly has a place here.
It was necessary to link the individual sections of the directive with the IMO requirements and other documents from the third maritime package and, at the same time, to use the provisions of other binding documents that are in force in the European Union, e.g. in the area of the confidentiality of personal data.
I think the conciliation procedure will manage to achieve a highly successful resolution to all of the questions that remain open, including a clear formulation of the requirement concerning decent treatment for the crews of ships involved in disasters.
The formula used here conforms to the corresponding parts of the Sterckx directive, i.e. an EU information and control system for operating ships, as my colleague has otherwise briefly mentioned.
In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks for the collegiate approach to the task shown by the amendment proposal authors, for the very amenable attitude of the European Commission staff and of the individual countries holding the presidency, i.e. Germany, Slovenia and France, who participated in the work.
A major contribution to the quality of the text was also made by the specialist assistants. I received support in the first phase of the work, for example, from Hannes Kugi, among others, and in the conciliation procedure from the remarkably tireless Katrin Huber.
It is thanks also to them that the resulting directive is a practical and usable document which can only be recommended for the attention of the specialist public.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, in this session, we are concluding a lengthy piece of work and I believe that we should all consider ourselves satisfied with the results achieved.
We should be satisfied for a variety of reasons, which are those that concern the Union as a whole, because it is clear that allowing the European Union to create for itself regional regulatory areas where international standards already exist to govern them, and to come between the Member States and international organisations in defining rules, is something that must only be done when necessary.
Yet it is clear that it was necessary.
Unfortunately, the incidents that set the process in motion made it clear.
The result achieved is a result that, I believe, cannot satisfy everyone, in the sense that it is an honourable compromise of a lengthy piece of work, which has seen all the institutions involved - the Commission, Parliament and the Council - play their part, with each representing the interests they are appointed to represent, so to speak.
This ensures that the whole sector and the whole framework of maritime safety have today taken a step forward.
After all, my colleagues and I have had the honour and the opportunity to tackle more specific problems.
I had the responsibility and pleasure of dealing with the liability of carriers, in the event of accidents involving passengers on board.
I must, of course, admit that, as always, the result falls short of our stated ambitions, ambitions that sometimes even seemed like they might be achieved.
The ambition was to immediately extend cover and protection to everyone who gets on board a ship, whether in international waters, national waters or on rivers.
However, the reality of the situation, so to speak, required that the scope be partially reduced.
I am aware, let us say, but I cannot fail to point out that something is missing from this set of rules, owing to the fact that many ships that travel indiscriminately between rivers and the sea are not covered in this way and, certainly, this is a point that should be covered somehow.
I am sure that the Commission will make provisions along these lines as soon as possible.
We set, however, a rather long period to ensure that voyages in domestic waters are also covered.
This problem regarding the length of time is a problem of transition periods, and perhaps it is an issue that we underestimated.
I am afraid that the risk we run is that they are too long and that we will therefore have to wait too long for this.
It is better, however, that they are there, rather than not having changed anything.
The other main discussion point - and, still, the point we have reached - is that this protection begins at a certain time.
Certainly, we can now tell our fellow citizens that when they get on board a ship they are covered, in basic terms, from the end of 2012, irrespective of how they travel.
To sum up, we have, also from this point of view, enabled all citizens to feel a little more European, since the same cover will apply in any sea, in any location, for any ship.
Mr President, Commissioner, here we are at the end of a legislative marathon that, as has been mentioned, has taken ten years and that, as we were reminded in a debate this morning, has been given the inappropriate name of 'Erika III'.
It is inappropriate because, after the Erika, there was the Prestige; after the Prestige, there was the Tricolor; and, after the Tricolor, there were unfortunately plenty of other maritime disasters both in European waters and beyond.
Above all, though, it is inappropriate because, as Mr Sterckx pointed out, this is cool legislation, for the first time - in other words, it is free of the passions, excesses and polemics that take over in the wake of disasters such as the Erika and the Prestige.
I think it is very much to the credit of Mr Barrot and the Commission that they have proposed it, but it was also a formidably difficult matter.
The Member States are not exactly inclined to legislate in fields like this when nothing serious has happened; sometimes, on the other hand, they go overboard with the legislation when there are accidents.
In any event, this really is a major piece of legislation, since it contains seven texts.
It aims to make the European maritime space - or rather, that of the Member States - one of the safest in the world.
This is perfectly justified given that it is also one of the busiest in the world and, in geographical terms, one of the most complicated in the world.
We have a number of straits, including the Bosphorus, Gibraltar and Pas-de-Calais - through which 800 commercial ships pass every day - which are among the largest ports on the planet.
We therefore had a lot of work to do, not, unfortunately, to ensure that there are no more accidents - life will always be random - but so that we could be sure that we had done our best to prevent them, and also to punish the causes of any such accidents.
The structure of this package is simple: it is a virtuous circle, in which each link in the transport chain - from the port state to the insurer, via the charterer, the classification society and the flag state - is responsible for its own actions and in some way applies pressure - or at least that is what we are betting on - to clean up transport conditions and to ensure that they are using a responsible transporter that complies with the standards.
Thinking about it, moreover, perhaps it would have been worth basing our model, in terms of its broad principles and structure, on what we are trying to do in the field of finance: The financial ratings agencies have been just as inadequate as the maritime classification societies.
Certain Member States accommodate flags of convenience, or tax havens as they are known in the field of finance.
Certain operators are not wanted, and are subject to blacklisting or bans in the maritime field.
This is, then, a quite exemplary piece of legislation and, moreover, one that fits into the framework of the IMO at international level.
I would also say that, in political terms, this is a truly remarkable success for the Community, because the link between the Commission and Parliament has made it possible to produce a very complicated text and piece of legislation about which the Member States were very reticent.
I would like to thank Mr Tajani and the Commission.
I would also like to thank the French Presidency, because I think that Mr Bussereau realised that this could be something very important during the French Presidency, and I would like to thank all of my fellow Members, because everyone here knows that we made use of subterfuge and magic tricks to get to this point.
We have only managed to bring in this maritime package in as much as we have been united, and have shown solidarity to such an extent that certain fellow Members have, so to speak, inherited some stowaways, such as my text and that of Mr Fernandes, which the Council did not want.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we have succeeded.
I would have liked to go into the details of my report, but I think I will have some time to speak at the end, which will give me the opportunity to do so.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, discussion of the Erika III maritime safety package is drawing to a close.
This process is more than three years old and, during that time, we have argued strongly for more safety for passengers, oceans, seas and maritime routes.
As a Portuguese and a Madeiran, it is thought that I was especially committed to this project and its main goals: ensuring that Member States comply consistently with their obligations as members of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), adopt that organisation's conventions and fully apply their mandatory provisions.
The negotiation process was difficult.
For Parliament, the Erika III package was always a package and never a collection of cobbled together measures.
At the time of first reading, Parliament adopted some amendments.
These included the obligation for the flag state to ensure that inspectors and investigators have the correct training and to create capacities for assessment, approval and authorisation of ship and equipment building, the obligation for Member States to obtain documentary evidence of ships' compliance with international standards - if a ship is not newly built, the Member State is obliged to liaise with the previous flag state and ask it to pass on the necessary documents and data - and the maintenance of a fleet database, which must include the main technical information on each ship, including infringements of IMO conditions.
At that time, we reached political agreements on six of the eight proposals.
My own proposal and that of Mr Savary remained to be agreed.
We have now reached agreement on how these two proposals also can be included in the final text of the Erika III package.
Thanks to Parliament and its perseverance, to the Slovene and, especially, the French Presidencies - whom I thank - and, finally, to the common will of us all, we can now conclude this third maritime safety package.
It is important to highlight the ratification of international conventions using the national method in this process.
That was a position which I supported out of respect for the various ratification systems in existence in the various Member States.
Whilst waiting for the IMO audit scheme to become mandatory, Member States have to subject their maritime authorities to such an audit and publish the results.
Member States will put in place a quality management system for their maritime authorities, which is certified in accordance with international standards.
Before authorising a ship to fly their respective flag, Member States have to check that it complies with international rules.
Member States have to make sure that ships which fly their flag and have been detained in the context of a port state inspection are brought into conformity with the relevant IMO conventions.
When a Member State's flag appears on the blacklist or the grey list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control for two consecutive years, it has to submit a report on the reasons for the poor performance to the Commission.
In parallel with the common position, Member States will confirm in a joint declaration their commitment to ratify the main international conventions on maritime safety before 1 January 2012, apply the IMO Flag State Code and the related audit scheme for maritime authorities, and encourage the IMO to make these two instruments mandatory worldwide.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this third maritime safety package is a significant victory in the European legislative process.
The Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have proposed, debated, come to agreement on and accepted a text that improves the lives of citizens and businesses, promotes better security on the seas and oceans and prepares our future.
My participation in this process was a great honour.
When we vote on this package shortly, we will be paying tribute to the victims of all the past or recent maritime tragedies: from the Prestige to the Erika, and from Bolama to Estonia.
We will also be helping to avoid or reduce the consequences of similar events in the future.
Mr President, today we have completed a difficult task, a hard road that the Parliament, Council and Commission have trodden together, beset by difficulties to be overcome, technical problems and some not inconsiderable conflict.
Now I would like to address not only all my fellow members in this Chamber, who are about to put the final seal on our work to introduce a new maritime package, but also all the European Union citizens that you represent.
On the eve of the European elections, concluding this difficult task means sending out a strong message from the institutions to all European citizens.
The job of the European institutions is to impose rules in response to issues raised by the public.
When they have to, they can overcome difficulties and reach an agreement for the greater good of the half a billion Europeans who live within our borders.
They are capable of sending out a message to guarantee safety.
They are capable of sending out a message to protect the environment.
They are capable of sending out a message to defend the rights of passengers.
They are capable of sending out a message to protect companies and ensure the rules are respected.
Because, in Europe, we traditionally base our legal system on cast-iron legal certainties, introducing new rules to the maritime sector means again giving European citizens rules, rules that they can respect, rules that can improve conditions in the transport system; better conditions for this important sector that affects our seas.
This is the reason I wanted to stress the importance of your vote over this package because, over and above its actual contents, it represents a political message sent out by the European institutions.
The scope of this decision transcends our immediate needs, transcends the issues we are dealing with, that you have decided to turn into rules with the consent of the Commission and the Council.
I would like to reiterate: this is a political choice, a message we are sending out to European citizens to have faith in their institutions, because they are able to tackle problems and resolve them.
So I certainly want to thank the Commission staff that made it possible for first Mr Barrot and then myself to work as effectively as possible.
I want to thank the French Presidency and the Slovenian Presidency.
I want to thank Mrs Bussereau for all the work she put in during the knottiest stage of the negotiations, and I also want to stress the important work done by all the rapporteurs, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and Parliament as a whole.
My thanks also to Mr de Grandes Pascual, to Mrs Vlasto, to Mr Sterckx, to Mr KohlÃ­Äek, to the Chairman, Mr Costa, to Mr Savary - whom I thank once again for his work - to Mr Fernandes for his contribution and his ability to ultimately close the negotiations by overcoming even partisan or entrenched attitudes in the attempt to give the public some tangible answers.
Our challenge was to consolidate European legislative instruments to fight illegal shipping and prevent maritime accidents and the pollution of our seas.
We must now use all the maritime transport regulatory instruments at our disposal to prevent the recurrence of the accidents that spurred us to action.
These instruments firstly concern the Flag State, which bears primary responsibility for maritime safety, and a political line has now been drawn.
All European Flag States must, without exception, be on the white list and be in possession of instruments designed for this purpose.
A consolidated framework for European accreditation of classification companies will also allow us more effective control of our shipping.
Other devices will be applied to the Port State.
Certain ships and shipping companies must no longer be welcome in our waters because they do not meet minimum safety regulations.
Coastal states are subject to yet another set of measures: effective monitoring of ships over short and long distances represents an essential preventive tool.
Reinforced rules on the accommodation of ships in distress in a place of refuge will make sure we can prevent shipping accidents from turning into environmental disasters.
We must act to prevent whilst also taking responsibility for the consequences of accidents and learning lessons from them.
Shipping companies must take out adequate third party and passenger liability insurance policies.
A common investigatory framework will also provide us with optimum feedback on accidents so we can learn from them.
It goes without saying that risk cannot be removed altogether from maritime transport, as it is from other sectors, but it is the duty of the law maker, the duty of whoever represents the public, to do their best to limit these risks as far as possible.
So I believe that this is our common goal.
I believe that we have made a step forward that is important by any standards.
The package you are about to adopt certainly represents a great stride in the right direction and - I reiterate - a great political message, a great sign of will by the European institutions to provide answers to the questions asked by 500 million citizens.
Thank you very much, Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, first of all, to thank all the rapporteurs on behalf of my group, not only for their work itself, but also for the fact that we have achieved what we set out to do, namely to treat the proposals as a package.
By treating them as a package, we forced the Council to move towards us as you know that the Council most definitely did not want to adopt two proposals.
Only by standing together did we manage to get the Council to take on these two dossiers, and we succeeded.
I share the view of the Vice-President that this package is a great success for the citizens.
That is something we should say in the election campaign, too.
Looking around, there are not that many Members here for this debate this afternoon, despite the fact that putting this package together was one of the greatest achievements of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
The citizens perhaps do not understand, sometimes, why we sit for so long and why everything takes so long.
Here, however, they can see, that this package consists of regulations on monitoring, regulations on classification societies, accident investigations, insurance obligations, liability regulations, on port State control and flag State control.
We need to tighten up the requirements for all these different aspects in order, where possible, to prevent accidents and, where accidents do happen, to be able to react quickly.
Mr Sterckx, I would like to offer my particular thanks to you once again, as you were the rapporteur in the special committee that I had the honour of chairing, and we met again after the Prestige sinking to consider what we still needed to improve.
Through Mr Barrot, the Commission essentially adopted our proposals and we actually finalised them through the legislative process.
To that extent, we can be really pleased to be able to agree the third maritime package after all these years.
Let me make two more points, however.
The first is that we should thank Dominique Bussereau who, as a French minister, in the end pushed the package over the final hurdles, enabling it to succeed.
We should give him particular credit for that.
Mr Vice-President, all eyes are on you, now!
You, the Commission, with your fine European Maritime Safety Agency, must now ensure that the Member States also implement and apply this.
It is only when what we have decided is actually applied that we will be able to succeed in preventing the recurrence of accidents like those of the Erika and the Prestige.
We should be fighting together to achieve that.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, I have just had a real race to get to the Chamber.
I was in my office listening to Vice-President Tajani and the other speakers, and I feel I have to congratulate all the rapporteurs and the Commission.
Like Mr Tajani, I, too, would like to warmly and gratefully acknowledge the work carried out by Commissioner Barrot, which was very important, and also the goodwill shown by the French Presidency.
I want to say here that this maritime package is going to usher in a decisive change in Europe, one that will foster quality and transparency in the maritime sector.
I believe it will ensure that we will never again witness the spectacle of the lack of transparency that we have seen in the past, after those two terrible accidents of the Erika and the Prestige, particularly the lack of transparency surrounding the Prestige accident.
In this context, Mr KohlÃ­Äek's report, for which I am a shadow rapporteur, is a guarantee - in fact, the guarantee - that investigations in the maritime sector can, in future, be carried out in total transparency.
It will ensure that all of us - the general public and the authorities - will know what was behind or what happened after every accident, so that the same mistakes can never be made again and so that anything that is done badly can be corrected.
Europe has to go further in this field and I am sure that our work is not going to end here, because we have always been leaders and also because maritime traffic is not going to stop growing.
Thank you, Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result that has been achieved here and to thank the French Presidency for its efforts.
The result that we have achieved is a great success for the environment and for European shipping.
In recent years it has largely been the EU that has set the standard for the impact of shipping on the environment through legislation and through the work of the International Maritime Organisation.
Shipping is a global activity and, for the sake of fair competition and for the sake of the environment, it is important to have common rules at a global level.
However, the EU could take the lead and set the standard by demanding more stringent rules.
We must ensure that the EU Member States actually comply with the IMO agreements and this is what we are doing with the legislative package that we are concluding here.
The seven directives in the third maritime package will prevent pollution, ensure a better coordinated response to accidents and prevent poor ships from entering EU waters.
I have paid particularly close attention to the Directive on port State control and the Directive on the investigation of accidents as the shadow rapporteur for my group, and I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Vlasto and Mr KohlÃ­Äek, for their proficient and successful work.
We have achieved a better method of inspecting ships, so that it is the poorest ships that are inspected most often and we have a method of investigating accidents that will provide legal protection for those questioned, the witnesses, and that will also mean that what we learn from the accident report can be utilised in future and that the information can be exchanged between Member States.
Thank you, Mr President, we have every reason to express our deepest satisfaction with the maritime package and I would like to say thank you on behalf of our group for the sterling work carried out by the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council in this area.
Now, ship surveys affect large ships in particular, and I would like to highlight a problem with small ships.
We have special competent bodies to carry out inspections, but we do not have sufficiently clear rules for the seaworthiness of these ships or for when the inspection is to be carried out.
This is particularly the case with regard to fishing vessels, small fishing vessels that have been rebuilt, either to continue fishing or to be used for tourism-related purposes.
This often involves an increase in weight and an increase in engine size, which alters the centre of gravity and reduces seaworthiness, and, in my country, Denmark, we have seen numerous tragic accidents as a result.
We need to introduce a fixed requirement for every vessel, whether new or rebuilt, to undergo a seaworthiness test.
Therefore, like Mr Costa, I would like to ask the Commission to extend the provisions on survey and approval to include these types of ship as soon as possible.
Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, support this final compromise.
We are pleased that Parliament has prevailed, with the result that all eight legislative proposals form a single package to be voted on together.
I would like to thank all the rapporteurs from the bottom of my heart for their collaboration.
Marine safety urgently needs stricter European legislation in order to save lives and prevent environmental disasters by preventing accidents.
There must be no repeats of the shipping accidents involving the Erika and the Prestige.
Port State control means that ships that call at EU ports can be better monitored and - this is something we think is important - these ships can face sanctions where they fail to satisfy the safety provisions.
The monitoring of ships in territorial waters is extremely important, especially in environmentally sensitive areas, as pollution of the seas and the oceans recognises no boundaries.
That is why cross-border action is urgently required.
In the liability regulation in favour of passengers on passenger ships there is, unfortunately, only a regulation for the maritime area.
We Greens would have liked to have seen it apply to inland waterways too.
Finally, we are pleased that, after a long delay, the Council has also decided on the obligations of the port States and the insurance and liability of shipowners.
With this port package, we have taken a mighty step forwards, knowing that these rules can and must be improved still further in future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, repeated accidents and an increase in the transport of dangerous goods by sea constantly raise acute issues regarding strengthening the safety rules governing all maritime straits in the European Union and the resources needed in order to enforce these rules.
In particular, it makes sense to classify these straits and approach routes to them in accordance with the procedure relating to 'Seveso zones', because transport must come down to a drive to reduce costs whatever the consequences.
The Commission and the Council, under pressure from economic disasters set off by the financial crisis, are finally thinking about calling tax havens into question.
If this can actually be put into action, it could be a real step forward.
Along the same lines, how many more maritime and environmental disasters do we need to have before the Commission, the Council and this Parliament will finally turn their attention to the long-standing scandal of flags of convenience?
Perhaps, though, it would be wiser for the European electorate to fill Parliament with more MEPs who care more about working for the safety of their fellow citizens than about standing up for free trade, which destroys people and the environment.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, last September, I drew attention to how the electronic data of ships required in these reports could easily find their way to pirates operating off Somalia.
This was not heeded.
These reports have been modified, but not for the better.
In fact, there is now contradiction between them.
I will try again.
Whilst Mr Sterckx obliges ports not to turn ships away, Mr Savary says that they can deny entry if insurance certificates are not being provided.
Add the further contradiction of Mrs Vlasto, which extends port control to ships anchored offshore.
So, if a vessel with no papers lies offshore and then, due to extreme weather, becomes at risk, it must be allowed entry because Mr Sterckx established the right of ships in distress to a place of refuge.
So we come to the situation of a vessel with a dangerous cargo finding its way into a port by manipulating these contradictions.
What happens if it then results in a serious incident, closing a major port?
Would the compensation mentioned in Mr Sterckx apply to all of that and, in any case, who pays?
These reports need a real overhaul.
Finally, the Fernandes report endorses various IMO recommendations.
Fine - the UK has already signed these - but the EU wants to add its own fleet database, to which I and others would object.
I say 'would' because the Fernandes report is to be adopted without a vote.
How democratic is that?
Whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending House?
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, who have answered the big questions raised by the challenges of maritime safety and have faced up to our responsibilities.
We all remember the disasters involving the petrol tanker Erika in 1999 and the Prestige in 2002, and their tragic ecological, human and economic consequences.
A new arsenal of laws to protect Europeans from maritime disasters will now, finally, see the light of day, providing, in particular, for systematic inspections of the most antiquated ships, compulsory insurance to compensate the victims of ecological disasters, and also audits on the flags of European countries, which, as we know, are still far too often flags of convenience.
It was high time to take these measures, which do indeed restrict the vast room for manoeuvre that shipowners have been allowed for centuries.
They bring an end to the impunity of owners of hulks, and inspections will be made even more effective by being targeted at such ships.
The safety of the seas and oceans is not up for negotiation: it is this, and not money, profit and unrestricted trade, that should be the primary reference value.
I do have one regret.
It is going to take a long time to implement all these new repressive and preventative laws.
As an MEP for the North-West region, with its numerous shorelines, I am relieved and proud to be voting in favour of this third maritime package.
(EL) Mr President, the package of seven proposals on shipping is an important development in preventing accidents and in safeguarding an effective response in the event of an accident.
As far as the latter is concerned, I should like, as shadow rapporteur, to refer in particular to what was agreed on refuges for vessels in danger.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, and the entire negotiating team on achieving a valuable compromise on this important issue.
If one small accident, one small crack, for example, in the tank of an oil tanker, is not contained and confined, it may result, in the event of vibrations from rough seas or difficulties in decanting the cargo to another vessel, in a huge ecological disaster if there is no refuge where appropriate measures can be taken.
At the same time, fear on the part of the crew that they are in danger of suffering criminal or civil consequences or the fact that the vessel has inadequate insurance may prevent refuge from being sought, with unfortunate consequences.
The present compromise safeguards the independence of the experts who decide if a ship in danger is to be given refuge, fair treatment for seamen in the event of an accident in accordance with the ÎÎÎ, the obligation of uninsured ships in refuges, compensation for ports and refuges for damage, on which the Commission will present various policy options, and the obligation of oil tanker owners to notify their cargo if it exceeds 1 000 tonnes.
At the same time, all vessels, including fishing vessels, will need to fit an automatic recognition system.
To close, I welcome the fact that Parliament's actions have pushed the Council into adopting a final common position on all seven legislative proposals in the package.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the package on which we will be voting tomorrow would have come to nothing without the will of the European Parliament, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work that has been done.
If the European Union creates a legal instrument that, as I hope, will make it possible to prevent disasters such as the shipwrecks of the Erika or the Prestige and finally to make the polluters take responsibility, it will be thanks to the European Parliament's perseverance in the face of the Council's timidity.
There is no point in reminding you of the resolve that has been required in order to bring the reports by Mr Savary and Mr Fernandes to the table.
This is a political victory for the European Parliament, and it is also a victory for steadfastness and working together.
Thanks to this 'maritime safety' package, the Member States will finally have to fulfil their obligations in the International Maritime Organisation and, in particular, carry out technical audits before issuing a flag to a ship.
Another consistent step forward is the requirement for ships to be insured by financial guarantee certificates, which will put real responsibility on their charterers.
If Parliament adopts these texts tomorrow, the European Union will be showing that it has provided itself with an effective tool to fight against waste ships and against criminal charterers and owners, and it is to be hoped that the environment and the health of our fellow citizens will benefit.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the work that has been done in this field by Mr Tajani, who is here today, and the rapporteurs on transport law, because we have now embarked on the final stages of the process on maritime law with the aim of covering all transport in Europe.
It is therefore in relation to that work, which has seen a real delay in maritime transport, that, I hope, Parliament will also be able to round off an important strand on maritime transport during this session or, at any rate, as soon as possible.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we can end the current Parliamentary term with the final adoption of the last of the maritime packages.
I remember, however, that when I first came to the European Parliament in 1999, we had a serious maritime accident off the French coast with the Erika, which gave its name to the first set of legislative proposals designed to avert and prevent accidents.
We thought we had warded off the danger, but soon afterwards, the coastline of Galicia was ruined by the tar from an even worse accident than the previous one: the Prestige.
Since then, we in the Committee on Transport and Tourism have worked on a succession of legislative packages in an attempt to overcome the excessive resistance we have encountered among shipowners, oil companies, classification societies and also certain Member States, which rejected the three proposals for being too stringent.
Over the last 10 years, we have adopted a number of directives and regulations, some of which we have had to go back and revise because they proved ineffective in their initial versions, as a result of the cuts made by the Council.
We adopted legislation to introduce double-hulled vessels, a European fund for major oil disasters, and ports of refuge, and now we are revising and adopting legislation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea, the investigation of maritime accidents, the Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, port state control and, lastly, the regulation and directives on ship inspection and survey organisations.
All this is good and it is desirable that it should enter into force and be implemented by all the Member States as soon as possible.
I am pleased at that.
However, this Parliament's term is coming to an end.
I am leaving Parliament, and I am going with the regret that we have not succeeded in making it compulsory to introduce control systems - which already exist and have been patented - to show when and what amounts of bilge and oil tank residues have been illegally dumped into the sea by a particular vessel.
In other words, they are a kind of black box or tachometer that can be inspected by the maritime authorities whenever a vessel enters port.
I believe we owe the marine environment greater attention and stricter procedures to avert all the pollution we cause.
I also think that, if we fail in this, it will affect our food chain and our lives, and we will end up paying a high price for it.
I trust it will not take another 10 years to control illegal discharges at sea more effectively and efficiently.
Thank you, Mr Ortuondo Larrea.
I am sure that your efforts will be remembered in this House, and I am also sure that, wherever you are, you will continue fighting for the objectives that you are leaving here.
They may be unfinished, but they are well on the way to completion thanks to your efforts.
(EL) Mr President, after five years of debate and consultation with the Council, the much-vaunted shipping package of six directives and one regulation has been stripped of any positive content to do with the safety of life at sea and environmental protection.
In other words, the mountain has brought forth a mouse.
The Council, loyally expressing the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and the interests of capital, is implementing all the demands of operators and shipowners and of the monopoly business groups which oppose any measure which might even minimally affect their profitability.
Thus, they have managed, through this long, drawn-out procedure, either to remove the teeth of every positive provision designed to control safety rules for ships or to postpone them indefinitely.
No measure has been included to protect and upgrade the human factor, the seamen, the primary factor in the protection of human life at sea and the environment.
The submissions put forward by the European Union since 1986, within the framework of the common shipping policy, that issues relating to the human factor, to improved working conditions and training of seamen, will allegedly be examined in the future, are misleading and false, given that they have been deteriorating all these years.
That is why the Greek Communist Party will vote against the so-called shipping package in its entirety.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism could not, and cannot, avoid the task of providing a holistic response to the need to improve shipping safety and also to lay down the measures to be taken in the event of accidents.
The third maritime package also deals effectively with issues of the liability of carriers in relation to their passengers and the goods they carry.
It was about time, always assuming that the matter is not disregarded, as I have the impression is happening in the case of airline passengers' rights.
I actually believe that the goals for category A ships to come into line by 2016 and the even later deadline set for category B, C and D ships are too lenient and give the carriers too much leeway.
I hope that this largesse by the European Union is repaid by the carriers' prompt compliance with the new regulations.
We needed, and still need, common standards for classification companies which are responsible for monitoring ships and granting shipping permits, and also very clear rules governing inspections and the addition of ships to the blacklist.
I therefore welcome the proposals and also the measures for managing accidents and shipping and environmental disaster risks and the relevant responsibilities, which I call on the Commission to make a greater commitment to uphold.
The far-ranging package also considers measures on investigations, on competences and on just sovereignty in the event of maritime accidents, a compendium which, I hope, will help clarify issues of liability and compensation.
I therefore voted for the set of reports.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Tajani, the course of the maritime safety package has been turbulent, but the outcome is pretty good.
This is largely thanks to the fact that Commissioner Tajani and his officials stood side by side with the European Parliament in encouraging the Council to seriously set to work on a number of crucial points that were so important to Parliament.
After all, there must be compulsory cooperation at European level if maritime safety is to be improved at the end of the day.
Fortunately, we have now sorted out a number of missing links, although Parliament would have liked to go further on a number of points.
The fact that independent accident investigation has now been made compulsory in case of major maritime accidents is progress, as this will make it possible to really get to the bottom of the cause.
There is already a great deal of experience with this in aviation.
Just last week, a Turkish Airlines aircraft crashed near Amsterdam in the Netherlands and, thanks to independent accident investigation, the cause had been determined within a week, putting an end to speculation.
It is real progress that we now have independent accident investigation, irrespective of culpability, in shipping too.
The rapporteur has done an excellent job in this regard.
Mr President, I should like to highlight another point in this package, namely the improved regulation of maritime passenger liability.
This is a good thing, but it is also good that inland waterways are excluded, as small inland waterway vessels cannot be treated in the same way as seagoing ships navigating on the high seas.
The two things are different and, ultimately, it is good that this has been confirmed in the proposal.
(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the maritime community has long discussed the need to improve the regulation, control and monitoring of vessel traffic due to risks of incidents, environmental pollution, danger to human life and illegal trafficking which, unfortunately, is far from negligible.
The integration of new technology into maritime traffic and the intensification of piracy, combined with the lack of any strict, general control, are premises underlying the problem.
Amending the directive establishes and develops conditions for a maritime safety network, as well as conditions for developing an effective, automated IT system.
These are achievements which must be assessed on behalf of the European Parliament, Commission and Council.
The framework for dealing with problems involving hazardous waste is important.
The application of the directive will not allow vessels carrying hazardous, unidentified cargo to pass through European waters looking for somewhere to dump its cargo.
Exercising control over maritime traffic is an absolute necessity.
A maritime safety culture must be created, the logistics for this process must be set up, a technical and technological basis must be provided for the system, a system must be created for distributing information efficiently while protecting part of this information which ensures the safety of traffic.
I welcome the efforts which the European Maritime Safety Agency is making, including with regard to developing a Vessel Traffic Management and Information System, while providing an integrated database, which includes displaying vessels in real time, along with other data linked to their cargo and its properties.
Even though the 'Erika' incident is already a textbook case in terms of learning to manage and analyse risk, I do not want a case like this to happen again or any more similar incidents to occur.
(RO) The compromise reached for the third maritime package will improve passenger safety, as well as help protect the environment and reinforce control systems.
The blacklist drawn up for ships which repeatedly breach the regulations will, just like in the aviation sector, mark an important step in improving safety.
Erika III is of particular importance to Romania as, in the wake of the documents recently adopted, An Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union and Black Sea Synergy, it may have an important say in the success of the process for extending European principles and good practice to the other littoral states which are not part of the European Union, using the new instrument proposed by the European Commission via the Eastern Partnership.
The measures relating to maritime transport must be supplemented by increasing cooperation between littoral states in order to make the most efficient use of resources and reduce the pollution resulting from activities carried out in ports and on shore, as well as along the whole course of the Danube.
The Black Sea can only be protected effectively through concerted action in every area.
Mr President, the package has been a very difficult one for Parliament and the Council.
There has been much negotiation and debate, and I am glad to see the issues have been finally resolved.
The adoption of this package is a victory for the European Parliament and certainly for the rapporteurs who have fought to ensure that we delivered on behalf of our citizens, even against very strong opposition from Member State governments.
This law will impact on a variety of areas, including the standards of European flags, ensuring improved inspection procedures for ships.
What we have now is more transparency and stricter inspections.
Essentially, this package will deliver safer vessels, meaning a lower risk of environmental disasters and loss of sea life.
From the point of view of Ireland, the timing is extremely important by virtue of the fact that we have a Latvian ship tied up in an Irish port where the crew have not been paid, they have not been given enough food and they have no way of getting back to their Member State, Latvia.
These are the kinds of issues that have to be tackled, and I look forward to the implementation of the package.
(RO) The third maritime package is extremely important.
The EU would like to develop the maritime corridors as part of extending TEN-T.
This maritime package helps increase maritime transport safety and puts into practice the lessons learnt from the sea accidents which have taken place in recent years involving the ships Erika and Prestige, along with accidents in the Black Sea.
In the case of the Black Sea in particular, this package will be particularly important as many of the Black Sea littoral states are on the Paris Memorandum blacklist or grey list.
Shipowners' liability should be applied in the event of an accident, including accidents which occur on inland waterways.
I believe that ships in distress must be received in specially equipped areas where they can be given the assistance they need.
However, the way in which these services are paid for must be clearly regulated.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Erika was shipwrecked, I was one of those Members in France who called on the French authorities to close the sluices so that the salt pans would not be polluted.
When the Prestige disaster occurred, I was co-rapporteur, along with Mr Sterckx, as we were jointly responsible for the topic of transport - I myself was responsible for the environment - and we quite justifiably called for greater safety in maritime transport.
I well remember how hard we fought in this very Parliament for an inquiry committee on the Prestige to be set up: it certainly made an impression.
Today, therefore, I think we can all be pleased with the fact that many international and European rules have moved forward as part of the maritime package, and I hope this will soon be nothing more than a bad memory.
However, I would like, if I may, to draw attention to...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I would like to reiterate, on the record, in relation to this most important maritime package, recital 3 of the review of the EU-ETS Directive, which was passed by an overwhelming majority.
This directive deals with our carbon dioxide emission reduction targets and the timetable for the same.
Recital 3 states that '[a]ll sectors of the economy should contribute to achieving these emission reductions, including international maritime shipping and aviation.
In the event that no international agreement including international maritime emissions in its reduction targets through the IMO has been approved by Member States and/or no such agreement through the UNFCCC has been approved by 31 December 2011, the Commission should make a proposal to include international maritime emissions according to harmonised modalities in the Community reduction commitment with the aim of its entry into force by 2013.
Such a proposal should minimise any negative impact on EU competitiveness, taking into account the potential environmental benefits.'
Comments please, Commissioner.
Mr President, we have come a long way as a Parliament since the Prestige, a tragedy to the coastline of Galicia and to its ecosystems.
We have come a long way since the Erika polluted and destroyed the wonderful coast of Brittany.
We have come a long way since Sea Empress, Exxon Valdez and other shipping disasters.
This package is a testament to the work of Parliament, the Commission and also, if belatedly, the Council.
For me, the significance of this package will be felt for many years to come.
It is a testament also to the work of all our rapporteurs and MEPs who, over the years, have pushed for such legislation.
This package is a victory for this Parliament, for Members from all the political groups, particularly on the Committee on Transport, although I hope Members would allow me to make special mention at this time of Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos and the late Mr Willi Piecyk.
Mr President, during the discussions that have taken place in this Chamber, amidst all the general satisfaction of seeing the Council, Parliament and Commission adopt rules that provide the public with tangible answers, I believe one overriding question has emerged: will all these good rules - that have been arrived at through compromise and a lot of hard work - be properly applied?
Will the Commission be able to ensure they are complied with?
Will the Agency be able to cooperate effectively with the Commission in ensuring the enforcement of these rules?
I refer to the comments that were made during the course of the debate - I am thinking in particular of remarks by Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Romagnoli - but also the letters that were sent to the Commission during recent months, by Mr Sterckx and Mr Simpson, who also raised the same problem.
I believe I can confirm the commitment of the Commission, which strongly urged the approval of this package, to ensuring its observation by the Member States.
I intend to call on the cooperation of the Agency - which is an institution in which I believe and one that has always worked effectively and fulfils its role of supporting the Commission and also of supporting the Member States in the best possible way - to implement this regulation as it has done with other regulations.
I visited Lisbon, where the Agency is based, and I found a great spirit of cooperation, great willingness and also great commitment and enthusiasm for applying all the rules in the package.
These will be guaranteed though the safety system, Safe Sea Net, and also all the other state-of-the-art technological tools used to help the public ensure that European Union rules are actually applied.
As you are well aware, when the law gives the Commission a specific responsibility, the Commission is able to call on the Agency to help it perform tasks of a technical nature.
I intend to continue moving in the direction taken by my predecessor, Jacques Barrot, and call on the cooperation of an agency that I consider to be efficient, well-run and full of people with the right attitude who believe in the work they are doing.
And that applies, for example, to the inspections that aim to check the correct application of regulations or the implementation of traffic monitoring information systems.
On the last point, I wish to stress the essential part played by the Agency - and I address my remarks to Mr Sterckx in particular - in the implementation of Safe Sea Net, the European platform for the exchange of data on maritime traffic, and in the setting up of a European long-range ship identification and tracking centre.
These tasks comply with the Agency's regulation, even though they are not specifically mentioned, because the latest amendment dates back to 2004, but they will certainly be included in the next revision of the regulation, which is currently being prepared.
The fact that these specific tasks are not mentioned in the directives or in the specific regulations has no bearing on the division of roles between the Commission and the Agency.
My intention, by replying, is to reassure Parliament of the Commission's will and determination to apply the rules that we are approving with the support of the Agency.
It would be pointless to tell the public: 'We've done something positive for you', if we were then unable to apply this positive thing and ensure it was respected.
We should bear in mind that the Member States, represented by the Council, are part and parcel of this agreement.
Because they are joint legislators with us, I believe the Member States will apply the rules we are approving.
There is no doubt that the Commission will ensure this commitment is respected and upheld and we will do so with the technical support of the Agency.
Mr President, I think we have reached the end, and we should all be very pleased that we have arrived at this moment after such a long journey.
If the codecision procedure is ever justified, I think it is in the case of this package and the way it has been handled.
The key to this package lay in the need to bring the Commission, the Council and Parliament to an agreement.
Parliament did very well to take the lead - it can be seen to be justified now more than ever - and in pressing to have this package considered absolutely essential.
Right from the start, we would not accept any kind of split or separation, so as to achieve a whole that could guarantee safety at sea.
I think we can be confident that there are guarantees for the future that ad hoc political measures will be superfluous.
We will thus save ourselves from disgraceful situations in which certain people in power criticise the positions of some governments and have to praise the positions of others.
In future, therefore, the major decisions will be in the hands of independent committees, who will make rigorous, authoritative, immediate and capable use of decision-making tools.
That will ensure that the decisions made are rigorous, right and fair.
That is because we have had to balance many different things here in this package: classification societies have had to be brought together with marine equipment; all interests have had to be put clearly on the table; and, above all, Parliament has had to show leadership.
We should be pleased at the fact that Parliament has shown this leadership.
It can now proudly say loud and clear that the European Union has not waited for the IMO - the International Maritime Organisation - but that we have taken the lead.
It was our duty, and we did not need to wait for anyone.
I think we can feel pleased and have hope for the future, trusting that mistakes will not be repeated and that we have learnt the lessons of the past.
