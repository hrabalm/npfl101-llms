Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architectures.
It was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346–1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575–1611).
It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and Austria-Hungary.
The city played major roles in the Bohemian and the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years' War and in 20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the World Wars and the post-war Communist era.
Data structures
Sequence types in Common Lisp include lists, vectors, bit-vectors, and strings.
There are many operations that can work on any sequence type.
As in almost all other Lisp dialects, lists in Common Lisp are composed of conses, sometimes called cons cells or pairs.
A cons is a data structure with two slots, called its car and cdr.
A list is a linked chain of conses or the empty list.
Each cons's car refers to a member of the list (possibly another list).
Each cons's cdr refers to the next cons—except for the last cons in a list, whose cdr refers to the nil value.
Conses can also easily be used to implement trees and other complex data structures; though it is usually advised to use structure or class instances instead.
It is also possible to create circular data structures with conses.
Common Lisp supports multidimensional arrays, and can dynamically resize adjustable arrays if required.
Multidimensional arrays can be used for matrix mathematics.
A vector is a one-dimensional array.
Arrays can carry any type as members (even mixed types in the same array) or can be specialized to contain a specific type of members, as in a vector of bits.
Usually, only a few types are supported.
Many implementations can optimize array functions when the array used is type-specialized.
Two type-specialized array types are standard: a string is a vector of characters, while a bit-vector is a vector of bits.
