# npfl101-llms

## Introduction

The main objective of the tutorial is to show participants how to get the training and inference of LLMs to work on Metacentrum and to give them some starting point.

You can also find in the introductory slides which provide links to more resources [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-bIBkhRq1-kIB5h5Ys9LBsQbPSj2homhA55VcNnn52Y/edit?usp=sharing)

You can also take a look at the [npfl087-llms](https://github.com/hrabalm/npfl087-llms) repository which contains similar (but possibly slightly outdated) tutorial for making Unsloth work on Metacentrum. There are also some additional notes regarding running Jupyter notebooks with the given environment, which we don't use here this time.
